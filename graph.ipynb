I NTRODUCTION\\n5G has seen exceedingly rapid growth and promising\\ncommercial deployment in recent years. Both academia and\\nindustry are accelerating the progress of 5G evolution with\\nenormous efforts. On the aspect of standardization, as early as\\n2015, three key principle usage scenarios, namely, enhanced\\nMobile Broadband (eMBB), ultra Reliable Low Latency Com-\\nmunications (uRLLC), and massive Machine Type Commu-\\nnications (mMTC), have been deﬁned by the International\\nTelecommunication Union (ITU) and followed by many orga-\\nnizations and groups [1]. In July 2016, the Federal Commu-\\nnication Committee (FCC) adopted a new Upper Microwave\\nFlexible Use Service [2]. Most recently in December 2017,\\nthe ﬁrst 5G new radio (NR) speciﬁcations were approved by\\nthe 3GPP [3], which marks a milestone for future large-scale\\ntrial experiments and wide commercial deployment.\\nOn top of the standardization progress, as 5G heterogeneous\\nnetworks become an immediate reality [4], [5], the applica-\\ntion and usage scenarios will be largely enriched and thus\\nbecome more diverse and complicated than ever. In particular,\\nthere have been and will be more spectrum enhancement\\ntechniques such as, carrier aggregation (CA) and spectrum\\nsharing paradigms represented by LTE licensed assisted access\\n(LTE-LAA) [6]. Implementing as many wireless standards\\nand technologies as possible on one single base station (BS)\\nor user equipment (UE) is ultimately desired, but techni-\\ncally challenging and commercially expensive, considering\\nthat both 5G cellular licensed high bands (HBs) such as 28,\\n37, 39GHz and WiFi mmWave bands (57-71GHz) pose very\\nimminent challenges. Furthermore, realizing multi-function,\\nmulti-standard user equipment is even more difﬁcult as it\\nis largely constrained by limited hardware resources, slow-\\ngrowing battery performance, and strict form factor require-\\nments.\\nIn this paper, we initiate an investigation and analysis\\nof contemporary and future wireless user equipment design.\\nAdditionally, we unveil detailed circuit and system designs for\\ncritical, cost-effective cellular-WiFi reuse with multiplexing\\ntechniques and architecture. The remainder of this paper is ar-\\nranged as follows: Section II thoroughly reviews and analyzes\\n5G wireless UE design, from both cellular and WiFi aspects;\\nSection III presents a new cost-effective cellular/WiFi physical\\nlayer design with speciﬁc circuits and systems implementation\\ndetails in a 5G UE; Section IV further presents more details\\nconsidering the 5G UE cellular-WiFi co-operation within 5G\\nheterogeneous networks, with concluding remarks in Section\\nV .\\nII. 5G WIRELESS USER EQUIPMENT DESIGN\\n5G UE design will be signiﬁcantly more complicated than\\ncurrent 4G ones in terms of the classic wireless hardware\\ndesign classﬁcations such as antenna design, radios frequency\\n(RF) design, baseband (modem) design, and PHY-MAC co-\\ndesign. This evolution is not only a consequence of new 5G\\ntechnolgogies such as massive MIMO (MaMi) [7], millimeter\\nwave (mmWave) beamforming (BF), and 5G new waveforms,\\nbut also the ultimate requirement of ever-growing high-end\\napplications such as wireless virtual reality (VR), ultra-high\\nresolution (UHD) video streaming, vehicle communications,\\nmachine learning, etc.\\n256\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Univ of Calif Riverside.

Wireless hardware block diagram of (a) conventional beamforming design, and (b) DPA-MIMO architecture.\\nOn the aspect of UE cellular design, employing mmWave\\nas 5G high bands brings up seveal major technical challenges\\nincluding, high propagation loss [8], serious human blockage\\nand human shadowing issues [9], high penetration loss, and\\nweaker diffraction capability due to the stronger particle nature\\nwhen frequency increases. Consequently, several techniques\\nsuch as beamforming and MaMi are utilized to deal with\\nthese challenges; however these techniques further generate a\\nseries of problems for practical hardware designs. Take human\\nblockage for instance, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a), a conventional\\ndesign method may place the mmWave beamforming module\\nin one speciﬁc location, e.g. the central part of the rear\\nhousing of 5G smartphone. However, such a design in Fig. 1(a)\\ncould lead to a serious human (hand) blockage issue which\\ncauses attenuation as large as 30-40 dB [10], [11]. Simply\\nincreasing the phased array dimension or effective isotropic\\nradiated power (EIRP) will generate more heat and cause a\\nheat distribution issue.\\nAn alternative design as shown in Fig. 1(b) accommodates\\ntwo BF modules on the top and bottom of the smartphone,\\nwhich helps partially solve the human hand blockage issue,\\nhowever the alternative design will be ineffective when the\\nsmartphone is horizontally held by two hands. Fig. 1(c)\\nproposes a structure named as a distributed phased array\\nMIMO (DPA-MIMO) [12] where multiple (=8 in Fig. 1(c))\\nBF modules are arranged in the rear housing. Such design\\nmitigates the human blockage issue, and enhances heat sinking\\ncapabilities, while sustaining a faster data rate through en-\\nabling higher spatial multiplexing gain. As depicted in Fig. 2,\\nconventional beamforming design usually employs a direct\\nconversion structure, whereas the DPA-MIMO architecture is\\ncomposed of multiple mmWave BF modules that realize con-\\nversion between 5G high bands and intermediate frequencies\\n(IF).\\nAs depicted in Fig. 3, the cellular IF-radio module further\\nprocess signals between radio frequencies (RF) and a baseband\\nfrequency.

Such\\na split-IF architecture, as shown in Fig. 4, can facilitate a\\nhighly re-conﬁgurable 5G UE design. As illustrated in Fig. 3,\\nthe quantity and placement of BF modules are ﬂexible as\\nlong as a necessary edge-to-edge spacing (>1.5 times free-\\nspace wavelength [14]) is maintained to guarantee enough\\nspatial isolation and channel capacity. Separating BF and\\nIF modules could also facilitate the reuse of BF and IF\\nmodules for other wireless standards. In addition, a mmWave\\nDPA-MIMO mobile handset proof-of-concept (PoC) hardware\\ndesign is presented by us in Fig. 5.

With this being said, IEEE 802.11ad/ay\\nstandards, known as WiGig, employ 60GHz bands that are\\nconstantly being expanded (57-71GHz in U.S.) and will play\\na critical role in future 5G heterogeneous networks.

Therefore, it would be wise\\nto co-exist mmWave cellular, mmWave WiFi, and 5G-LAA\\naltogether, to handle various application and usage scenarios.\\nIII. 5G CELLULAR WIFI CO-DESIGN\\nIntegrating aforementioned 5G wireless technologies and\\nfunctions on 5G UE devices is a commercial necessity, but\\ncostly and technically challenging, particularly considering the\\nlimited hardware space at the UE end. Hardware resource\\ncompetition between 3GPP cellular standards, and IEEE WiFi\\nstandards on a smartphone may additionally become a severe\\nproblem. For example, when both standards require multiple\\nBF modules, 5G UE designers need to arrange them within a\\nlimited hardware area. To further exacerbate the technical chal-\\nlenges, the mmWave BF modules are technically demanding,\\nexpensive, and power-hungry.\\nAs illustrated in Fig. 6, a cellular/WiGig mode switch is\\ninserted between coax cables and cellular IF-radios, as well\\nas WiGig IF-radios. As a result, the mmWave BF module can\\nbe multipexed for either WiFi WiGig or 5G cellular function-\\nality. Furthermore, cellular IF-radios can be also reused for\\ncellular sub-6GHz front ends and antennas through enabling\\nthe switches connected to them. Consequently, 5G mmWave\\ncellular, WiGig, and 5G sub-6GHz cellular can be reconﬁg-\\nured. In particular, WiGig and sub-6GHz cellular functions\\ncould be simultaneously activated on request.\\nA detailed circuit and system design example based on\\nDPA-MIMO architecture is given in Fig. 7. There are a total\\nofNBF groups of 5G mmWave BF modules, cellular IF-\\nradios, and NWiGig WiGig IF-radios. As noted, NWiGig should\\nbe no bigger than NBF. WiGig and 2.4/5GHz WiFi have\\ndifferent modems and low-layer MAC designs. The cellular\\nmodem will be complex as it needs to provide backward\\ncompatibilty to 3GPP legacy standards, as well as also support\\n5G NR that may employ several canidate waveforms [15],\\nsuch as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)\\nbased multicarrier waveforms. Examples of OFDM based\\nmulticarrier waveforms include cyclic preﬁx OFDM (CP-\\nOFDM), Discrete Fourier Transform-spread-OFDM (DFT-s-\\nOFDM), universal ﬁltered multicarrier (UFMC), ﬁlter bank\\nmulticarrier (FBMC), generalized frequency division multi-\\nplexing (GFDM), and single carrier (SC) waveform such as\\nsingle carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA).\\nOn the other hand, it is worthy to mention that, wideband\\n259\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Univ of Calif Riverside.

A higher MAC layer design and physical-\\nlayer-MAC-layer (PHY-MAC) cross-layer design should be\\ncarefully considered to enable more cost-efﬁcient co-operation\\nof cellular and WiFi or other wireless technologies. As shown\\nin Fig. 7, a cellular MAC block needs to work with a WLAN\\nMAC block to enable standalone (cellular/WiFi) functions or\\nfunctions requiring co-operation between cellular and WiFi\\nsuch as 5G-LAA. Additionally, 5G super carrier aggregation\\n(5G-Super CA), that involves an even wider range of bands,\\nsuch as from sub-6GHz licensed/unlicensed to above-6GHz\\nlicensed/unlicensed, may also be enabled.\\nFig. 8 illustrates a ﬂow chart illustrating an exemplary\\nprocess for multiplexed DPA-MIMO wireless communication\\nwhich comprises of several steps, namely, spectrum sensing\\nstep, determining network availability step, examining appli-\\ncation requirement step, network selection step, conﬁguring\\ncellular operation step, conﬁguring cellular and WiFi (5G-\\nLAA, or 5G-Super CA) operation step, and enable more cost-\\neffective PHY-MAC cross-layer architectures.\\nFurthermore, Fig. 9 depicts one of the situations when\\nwireless communication is established between a multiplexed\\nDPA-MIMO based 5G UE device, a WiFi router, and a cellular\\nbase station. In one speciﬁc operation mode, multiple BF mod-\\nules on the UE are enabled to communicate with the cellular\\nbase station using different carrier frequencies (particularly\\nfor neighboring modules) to mitigate potential interference.\\nMoreover, a 5G-Super CA mode can be operational when\\nunlicensed 71GHz band and WiFi 60GHz band are aggregated.\\nV.

Introduction \\nThe introduction of 5G networks marks a significant revolution in the telecommuni-\\ncations world, providing multiple advantages over predecessor technologies such as re-\\nduced latency and higher data rates [1]. Designed with high reliability and accessibility in \\nmind, these networks offer new functionalities to satisfy the exponential demand for ser-\\nvices and device connectivity, embracing both personal communication and Internet of \\nThings (IoT) application areas, including pervasive computing, healthcare, smart homes, \\nsmart cities, industrial automation, and vehicular networks [2]. \\nOne of the major drawbacks of 5G currently is the cost associated with deploying the \\nnew infrastructures required for the evolution and expansion of the mobile network. A \\npotential solution to mitigate this issue is the implementation of neutral hosts as network \\nservice providers (NSPs) to enable infrastructure sharing among multiple tenants, the cus-\\ntomer service providers (CSPs). The use of neutral hosts has been predominantly focused \\non rural areas, where deploying new networks might not be cost -effective for CSPs, as \\nwell as in public events and indoor spaces  where there is limited room for each CSP to \\ndeploy individual infrastructures [3]. Another advantage of a 5G neutral host is the pos-\\nsibility of enabling non-mobile network operators (MNOs) to supply 5G services to their \\ncustomers using the shared infrastructure. \\nFrom the CSPs’ perspective, the reliability of these networks may not be optimal due \\nto challenges in network management and commercial agreements, among other factors. \\nThe NSPs can use infrastructure virtualization to surpass those challenges, with '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/5G/2411.15505v1.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content=' \\n \\ntechniques such as network slicing [4]. These advancements make neutral hosts more ap-\\npealing and reliable; however, resource management and ensuring customer polic y con-\\ntrol are still challenges when using network slicing [5]. In this context, this paper proposes \\nan infrastructure-sharing architecture that enables neutral hosts to provide their tenants a \\nnetwork slice with a set of 5G network services, being capable of offering CSPs the ability \\nto provide a 5G service to their customers regardless of whether they are an MNO or not \\nand ensure network services to provide control over their customers. \\nThis paper’s main contributions are  as follows: the design of an infrastructure -shar-\\ning 5G network architecture that accommodates both types of tenants —MNOs and non-\\nMNOs; the selection of a set of 5G network functions (NFs) to provide the tenants with all \\nthe necessary services, improving NSPs’ scalability and resource management  while en-\\nsuring CSPs’ traffic isolation and policy control over their customers; the implementation \\nof the proposed architecture in a simulation environment using open -source tools; and \\nthe execution of multiple tests to validate the proposed architecture. \\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the back-\\nground and related work. Section 3 describes the proposed solution and its implementa-\\ntion, whereas Section 4 presents the results and discussion. Finally, the conclusions and  \\nsuggestions for future work are presented in Section 5. \\n2. Background and Related Work \\nThis section presents a literature review of relevant background concepts that were \\nused for the design of the proposed solution. Initially, an overview of the 5G network \\narchitecture is presented, followed by a description of various types of infrastructure shar-\\ning and neutral host models. Finally, an analysis of other works of significant interest to \\nthis paper is conducted. \\n2.1. 5G Networks \\nThe 5G architecture is structured around four key components: the user equipment \\n(UE), the radio access network (RAN), the transport network, and the core network (CN) \\n[6]. The UE encompasses end-user devices, including mobile phones, IoT sensor devices, \\netc., whereas the transport network links the two critical modules at the heart of the 5G \\nnetwork: the CN and the RAN. The 5G CN, or 5GC, is the central part of the 5G mobile \\nnetwork architecture, responsible for managing mobile voice, data, and Internet services.  \\nThe Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has delineated the 5GC architec-\\nture as a service-based architecture (SBA) composed of several modular entities known as \\nnetwork functions (NFs) [5]. The NFs communicate with each other using standardized \\ninterfaces, which allows for interoperability and flexibility in network deployment [4]. \\nThe 5GC NFs are exclusively software-based and are designed for cloud deployment, ob-\\nviating the need for dedicated hardware for each function  and enhancing deployment \\nagility and flexibility. \\nThe main NFs as described by 3GPP are [5] as follows: access and mobility manage-\\nment function (AMF), responsible for registration, authentication, and tracking of the UE; \\nsession management function (SMF), which establishes and manages sessions for user \\ndata, supports customized mobility management schemes together with AMF, coordi-\\nnates data routing and forwarding with the UPF, and is responsible for policy enforce-\\nment and QoS; and user plane function (UPF), which connects the mobile infrastructure \\nand the data network (DN), being responsible for packet routing and forwarding, packet \\ninspection, and QoS handling for the user plane. Other relevant functions that are used in \\nthis work are as follows: network repository function (NRF), which supports NF services \\nmanagement including registration, deregistration, authorization, and discovery; policy \\ncontrol function (PCF), which supports unified policy framework to govern network be-\\nhavior and provides policy rules to control plane functions; and security edge protection \\nproxy (SEPP), which supports message filtering and policing between service consumers \\non public land mobile network (PLMN) control plane interfaces. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/5G/2411.15505v1.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content=' \\n \\nThe RAN is responsible for managing the radio spectrum and ensuring the quality \\nof service (QoS) for the end -user through implementing the 5G base stations, known as \\ngNodeB (gNB), which provide wireless connectivity to the end -user devices. The gNB \\ntasks relevant to this work are the selection of an AMF at UE attachment when no routing \\nto an AMF can be determined from the information provided by the UE, the routing of \\nuser plane data towards the UPF(s), the routing of control plane information towards the \\nAMF, and the support of network slicing (NS) [5]. \\n2.2. Network Slicing \\nThe concept of network slicing involves the creation of configurable and independent \\nvirtual networks within the same physical network infrastructure. Each network slice can \\nbe tailored with dedicated resources, meeting the specific needs of the service it  aims to \\nprovide. Virtualization plays a pivotal role in enabling NS, allowing for the dynamic and \\nefficient allocation of physical infrastructure resources and ensuring individualized traffic \\nisolation within each network slice [7]. In this sense, within the realm of 5G, NS entails the \\namalgamation of necessary physical resources and virtual network functions (VNFs) to \\ndeliver a distinct service, isolated from others while sharing the same physical infrastruc-\\ntures. A network slice encompasses both control and user plane network functions within \\nthe CN, as well as the RAN, and is defined within the domain of a PLMN. Network slice \\nidentification is achieved through single-network slice selection assistance information (S-\\nNSSAI), comprising a slice/service type (SST) and a slice differentiator (SD) [8]. \\n2.3. 5G Roaming \\nRoaming refers to agreements between operators that allow for the expansion of a \\nhome PLMN (HPLMN) service coverage into areas where it is not present. This enables \\nsubscribers to use the services of another operator, whether in another country (interna-\\ntional roaming) or within their own country (national roaming). Two types of roaming \\narchitecture supported in 5G are identified [9]: \\n• Local breakout (LBO): In this model, the user ’s authentication and authorization on \\nthe visited network are performed by the home network, while the traffic is directly \\nrouted through the visited PLMN (VPLMN). \\n• Home routed (HR): In this scenario, the data traffic from the VPLMN is routed to the \\ndata network (DN) via the HPLMN. \\nFor communication between the HPLMN and the VPLMN, the Third-Generation \\nPartnership Project (3GPP) defined a new network function: the security edge protection \\nproxy (SEPP), which acts as a proxy between PLMNs to provide security and privacy to \\nthe involved entities. All control plane messages pass through the SEPP of both the home \\nand visited networks, ensuring the protection of messages before forwarding them to net-\\nwork functions or the service communication proxy (SCP). \\nThe SCP was introduced by the 3GPP in the 5G system to enable indirect communi-\\ncation between NFs. In addition to performing load balancing, the SCP also handles over-\\nload. The SEPP can forward messages directly to the NFs or opt to use the SCP. When \\nused, the SCP supports inter-PLMN routing, providing the necessary means for forward-\\ning messages relevant to the SEPP [9]. \\n2.4. Neutral Hosts \\nNeutral host models enable network sharing among multiple tenants under the man-\\nagement of MNOs or third -party business organizations, ensuring connectivity and cov-\\nerage for devices across public and/or private mobile network operators. \\nIn the context of 5G, neutral host networks provide a wide array of applications and \\nbenefits. Many use -cases for these networks are concentrated in rural areas, university \\ncampuses, public events, and indoor spaces. In rural areas, the cost of implementing indi-\\nvidual networks for each MNO is not justifiable due to low population density, making \\nneutral host  networks a suitable solution to minimize costs for all parties involved. In '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/5G/2411.15505v1.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content=' \\n \\nindoor areas, university campuses, and public events, the reduction in the space needed \\nfor infrastructure deployment, cost, and energy consumption makes infrastructure shar-\\ning an ideal solution [7]. \\nThis approach also enables MNOs to expand their mobile network coverage, ad-\\ndressing the increasing difficulty in acquiring sites for antennae and base stations, facili-\\ntating a swifter evolution of 5G, and reducing the cost and development time of technol-\\nogies to meet the functionalities and demands of 5G [3,7]. \\nHowever, neutral host models also present disadvantages and pose challenges in \\ntheir development. One major obstacle is the loss of end -to-end network visibility by op-\\nerators, leading to reliance on third -party companies for network maintenance. This can \\nresult in diminished control over service quality and customer experience. As a result, \\nservice-level agreements (SLAs) would become more demanding and complex [7,10]. Ad-\\nditionally, the lack of dedicated resources and software is a challenge as networks are not \\nplanned and designed with neutral host models in mind. Security and implementation \\nare also concerns. \\nFigure 1 illustrates different models for sharing 5G network infrastructures, catego-\\nrizing them into two groups: passive sharing and active sharing, where A and B represent \\ntwo different MNOs [11]. Passive sharing involves the sharing of non -electronic infra-\\nstructure components, such as sites and towers, power supplies, and the physical elements \\nof transport in backhaul, e.g., optical fibers. Site sharing is a common and straightforward \\npractice that allows operators to maintain their competitive strategies . It is operationally \\nsimple since the equipment is independent for each operator, yet it can still provide long-\\nterm cost reductions. Active sharing refers to the sharing of electronic components of the \\nnetwork, including elements of the RAN, such as base stations, antennae, controllers, etc. \\nIt can also encompass spectrum sharing and even sharing the CN, including servers and \\nnetwork functionalities. \\n \\nFigure 1. Classification of infrastructure sharing models (adapted from [11]). \\nRegarding RAN sharing, there are two main models: the multiple-operator core net-\\nwork (MOCN) and the multiple-operator radio access network (MORAN).  The MOCN \\ninvolves sharing the RAN and spectrum by multiple operators, whereas in the MORAN, \\nthere is no spectrum sharing, so operators must use their dedicated spectrum range. CN \\nsharing is much less common due to the complexity of operation and maintaining strategy \\ndifferentiation among operators, making it a less attractive model despite being more eco-\\nnomical than RAN sharing. \\nRoaming is also a form of infrastructure sharing. In the case of a neutral host, when \\nan operator lacks coverage in an area, it can use another operator ’s coverage through a \\nroaming agreement [9,11]. \\n2.5. Related Work \\nNetwork slicing is a technique that may be used for different purposes, including a \\nplethora of 5G scenarios at different network domains (RAN, CN, transport, general) and \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/5G/2411.15505v1.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content=' \\n \\neven with non -terrestrial networks [8,12]. The use of slicing in the RAN domain poses \\nresource management challenges, especially in spectrum time and spatial domain, with \\nmulti-tiered and AI -supported approaches being promising solutions [6]. Nevertheless, \\nthese solutions are out of the scope of this paper, which focuses on neutral host or multi -\\ntenant terrestrial mobile network architecture proposals  and does not take into account \\nthe spectrum sharing problem. \\nKassis et al. [13] proposed a RAN-sharing model based on a flexible network slicing \\nmechanism that leverages the efficiency of MOCN along with the spectrum isolation in-\\nherent in MORAN through a dynamic transition between these two scenarios. The imple-\\nmentation was based on open-source 4G software from OpenAirInterface (OAI) and used \\nan SDN approach to manage the separation of control and user planes in the MAC layer, \\nusing the FlexRAN RAN controller provided by the Mosaic5G project, which facilitates \\nthe real-time creation and configuration of network slices. The authors also proposed an \\nalgorithm for dynamic radio resource allocation for each slice. In their tests, they com-\\npared their approach to a static RAN sharing scenario and concluded that their archit ec-\\nture allows for efficient radio resource management, considering factors like traffic de-\\nmand, SLAs, and required isolation. Although the authors present an innovative proposal \\nfor RAN sharing among multiple operators, some potential challenges are the implemen-\\ntation complexity, the need for testing in diverse scenarios, and  the technically complex \\nmanagement requirements. \\nIn [14], the author proposed a neutral host architecture for indoor spaces where the \\nneutral host has complete control over the network infrastructures and elements, and the \\ninteraction with service providers (SPs) is established through roaming agreements. Using \\nthe Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum, in the 3.5 GHz band, which is \\navailable for shared commercial use in the United States, the architecture allows a single \\nsmall cell to serve multiple operators. To maintain the visibility and trust of the SPs in the \\nneutral host network, trust relationships between entities were established, along with \\nproviding detailed information about network performance quality through key perfor-\\nmance indicators (KPIs). This approach is similar to the one use d in this paper , as both \\nemploy roaming to authenticate users. However, the author does not consider the isola-\\ntion and separation of the traffic among SPs nor, consequently, ways to ensure and main-\\ntain the desired QoS as agreed in the contracts with the SPs. \\nGiannoulakis et al. [15] presented the architecture of the 5G SESAME project of the \\n5G public–private partnership (5G-PPP), which is composed of two main components —\\nthe cloud-enabled small cell (CESC) and the CESC manager (CESCM) —and leverages \\nSDN and NFV technologies to enable small cells to support multiple operators through \\nthe request of network slices from the infrastructure. The SESAME architecture envisages \\nthe separation of physical and virtual functions based on the MOCN m odel. \\nThe 5G-City project [10], which is also a 5G -PPP initiative, proposes an architecture \\nsplit vertically across three layers: service/application layer; orchestration and control \\nlayer; and infrastructure layer. The proposed architecture was deployed in three different \\ncities, Barcelona, Bristol, and Lucca, and the feasibility of deploying a multi -tenant virtu-\\nalized infrastructure was demonstrated. \\nAnother 5G-PPP initiative, the 5G-ESSENCE project [16], presents an interesting ap-\\nproach to edge network deployment and infrastructure sharing. It uses a two-tier system, \\nwith edge data centers for low-latency services and small cell virtualization and a central \\ndata center for heavy processing to support public safety applications, offering priority to \\nfirst responders and emergencies. Each supported public safety service was associated \\nwith a different network slice, and the project was validated using an LTE infrastructure. \\nThis paper’s proposal aims at solving the 5G infrastructure sharing problem by using \\nroaming and network slicing. Our neutral host architecture embraces two different types \\nof tenants: an MNO type, which receives only the necessary NFs to authenticate and con-\\ntrol its customer QoS; and a non-MNO type, which receives all NFs to provide a 5G service \\nto its users. This approach keeps the visibility and trust of the SPs , isolates and separates '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/5G/2411.15505v1.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content=' \\n \\ntraffic among SPs, and reduces the complexity and management by providing only the \\nnecessary NFs to each SP according to its needs and agreements. \\n3. Proposed Architecture \\nThe development of a 5G neutral host architecture plays a pivotal role in the evolu-\\ntion of a 5G network into a service -oriented format. This section presents a detailed de-\\nscription of the proposed architecture and its implementation using open-source software, \\noutlining the selected software and the decision -making process  and highlighting the \\nchoices and limitations involved. \\n3.1. Conceptual Architecture \\nThe proposed neutral host architecture aims to promote  efficient sharing of 5G net-\\nwork resources and infrastructures among different clients. For this purpose, it provides \\nservice without the need for third -party network elements in the connection and routing \\nof traffic while also allowing for any type of CSP, whether MNOs or not. \\nTo distinguish between different types of stakeholders throughout the paper, CSPs \\nwho are MNOs have been termed “operator clients”, while those who are not MNOs are \\nreferred to as “non-operator clients”. The NSP, which provides the shared infrastructure, \\nis named “neutral host”. Lastly, these clients may support various UEs corresponding to \\ntheir service subscribers, who are referred to as “users”. \\nThe proposed architecture, exemplified in Figure 2, leverages network slicing  and \\nRAN sharing with the LBO roaming architecture described in Section 2.3. This figure il-\\nlustrates three distinct network slices, each represented by a different color and dedicated \\nto a specific client. As represented, while all UEs access the network through the shared \\nRAN and the access and mobility management function (AMF), indicated by solid lines, \\neach client has its dedicated slice, responsible for managing the session, a long with the \\nuser plane function (UPF), session management function (SMF), and policy control func-\\ntion (PCF). In this example, two operator clients (Slice 2 and Slice 3), with their respective \\nPLMN IDs 2 and 3, are requesting service via roaming agreements, while the non-operator \\nclient (Slice 1), with PLMN ID 1, does not require roaming agreements and is authenti-\\ncated directly in the neutral host’s core. \\n \\nFigure 2. Conceptual neutral host architecture of the proposed solution. \\nFigure 3 represents the procedures undertaken to enable a new client on the neutral \\nhost network. The steps are slightly different depending on whether the client is an oper-\\nator or not. For an operator client, we use roaming agreements to provide user authenti-\\ncation and set up the neutral host SEPP; whereas for a non-operator client, it is necessary \\nto obtain a user database  and set UDM and AUSF to perform the user’s authentication. \\nGiven those different users and authentication methods, the user’s initial attach registra-\\ntion procedure also differs, i.e., from a roaming authentication to a direct NH \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/5G/2411.15505v1.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content=' \\n \\nauthentication, if it is from an operator or non -operator client, respectively, as illustrated \\nin Figure 4. \\nTypically, the predominant models proposed for neutral hosts focus either on passive \\nsharing or RAN sharing  with the implementation of MORAN or MOCN functionalities. \\nThese approaches have been the most common among MNOs for cost savings to date. \\nHowever, the advent of 5G and emerging technologies, such as NFV, SDN, and RAN cen-\\ntralization, broaden the operators’ perspectives with respect to new types of infrastructure \\nsharing, enabling MNOs to maintain network control even when operating on third-party \\ninfrastructures. Therefore, RAN sharing is a component of the proposed architecture, as \\nit is necessary to share the same RAN among different clients and, consequently, different \\nPLMN IDs. However, unlike the MORAN and MOCN models, this architecture does not \\nroute traffic to multiple cores, containing only the core of the neutral host and catering not \\njust to operators but also to non-operator clients. \\nThe proposed architecture aims for core sharing and leverages 5G -associated net-\\nwork slicing to provide an isolated and secure service for each client. This proposal in-\\nvolves implementing a core with all NFs but granting the client a network slice composed \\nof three NFs, namely, SMF, PCF, and UPF, which directly impact the user experience and \\nare crucial in controlling QoS and configuring user sessions. Thus, this architecture offers \\nflexibility and dynamism to the network, allowing clients to configure QoS p olicies and \\nmaintain visibility over their network slice. It also ensures isolation and traffic control for \\neach client, ensuring that the traffic and policies of one slice do not affect others. To meet \\nthese requirements, it is essential to have agreement s between the clients and the neutral \\nhost. Implementing techniques to share network performance indicators, monitoring \\ntools, and application programming interfaces (APIs) is crucial to ensure network visibil-\\nity for clients. \\nIn this architecture, roaming plays a crucial role in the authentication and verification \\nof users belonging to operator clients. The LBO model, chosen in our approach, allows for \\nuser traffic to be locally routed to the Internet, unlike the HR model, where traffic is di-\\nrected to the HPLMN. Despite the latter being seen as maintaining more visibility over \\nthe traffic for the MNOs, by providing a specific network slice for each clien t, together \\nwith an effective approach in terms of APIs and performance indi cators availability, the \\nproposed architecture allows them to maintain visibility and control over their users, QoS \\npolicies, and services. Roaming is fundamentally involved only in terms of authentication \\nand authorization. To maintain control over their users, the operator clients themselves \\nensure the authentication within the neutral host’s network, thus leveraging the standard-\\nized security and reliability for roaming. \\nFor non-operator clients’ users, authentication is performed on the neutral host’s net-\\nwork as is typical in traditional mobile networks, given that they do not require roaming \\nagreements. For operator clients in roaming service, the rationale is to allow the neutral \\nhost to use the same PLMN ID used by the operator client’s mobile network to provide \\nconnectivity to its users. This approach simplifies the switching process between the \\nVPLMN (neutral host network) and HPLMN (home network) for the user’s device, as the \\ndevices maintain a constant connection to the same PLMN ID. This ensures faster and \\nmore transparent network switching for the user, unlike what typically occurs in interna-\\ntional roaming, where prolonged service losses and roaming notifications a re common, \\nconsequently improving the user experience when using the neutral host network.

Flowchart of the authentication procedure. \\n3.2. Architecture Implementation \\n3.2.1. Software Tools \\nIn this work, several open-source software tools were considered for implementation \\nand testing of the proposed architecture. For the RAN simulation, notable options include \\nUERANSIM [17], OpenAirInterface [18], and my5G -RANTester [19], while for the CN, \\nOpen5GS [20], free5GC [21], and Openair-cn [22] are prominent. \\nIn the context of RAN simulation, UERANSIM was the chosen option. Although \\nOpenAirInterface offers more features, its usage demands significantly higher computa-\\ntional capacity and is also more complex to configure and use. Moreover, OpenAirInter-\\nface was unable to connect more than one UE to a gNB on the same virtual machine (VM), \\nwhich brought the necessity to use more VMs and, consequently, higher computer re-\\nsource demands. On the other hand, both UERANSIM and my5G-RANTester were found \\nto be simpler to use and configure and are capable of running on VMs with lower compu-\\ntational capacity. The choice of the former was based on the considerably higher availa-\\nbility of information on the Internet about it, its use in various projects, and the clear sep-\\naration between the UE and the gN B, unlike my5G-RANTester, which integrates both in \\nthe same terminal. Table 1 illustrates the most significant features taken into account in \\nthe choice of RAN simulator software for use in this work. \\n  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/5G/2411.15505v1.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content=' \\n \\nTable 1.

[23] con-\\nducted a study comparing the features of open-source software for simulating the 5G CN. \\nRegarding openair-cn, they concluded that it requires greater CPU capacity than the other \\noptions. Concerning free5GC and Open5GS, the authors concluded that both are easy to \\nconfigure, use, and integrate with UERANSIM. However, the selection of Open5GS was \\nbased on several key points. After testing both simulators, it was found that free5GC had \\nlimitations in handling different PLMN IDs. Although it correctly accepted and inter-\\npreted multiple PLMN IDs in the configuration, it failed to authenticate different UEs with \\ndifferent PLMN IDs. Furthermore, Open5GS has recently included support for r oaming, \\nwhich is crucial to this work and not available in the other two options. \\n3.2.2. Implemented System \\nTaking into account the chosen software tools and computational resource limita-\\ntions, a basic scenario was developed to implement and validate the proposed solution. \\nAccording to the proposed conceptual architecture (Figure 2), the RAN should support \\nmultiple PLMNs to simulate their sharing. However, since the UERANSIM RAN simula-\\ntor does not have this capability, we virtualized an instance of UERANSIM for each client \\nin a different VM. \\nRegarding the CNs, compared to the conceptual architecture proposed, the interfaces \\nimplemented by Open5GS are limited to the authentication of the UE. This means that \\nonly the AMF interacts with the operator’s CN for UE authentication and that it does not \\ninclude the necessary connections between the SMF and this CN for updating and verify-\\ning authentications. Regarding the slicing envisaged in the proposed conceptual architec-\\nture, there were also some changes in the implemented architecture due to some limita-\\ntions of Open5GS. Therefore, only the NFs SMF and UPF are part of each client ’s slice. \\nFinally, issues of billing policies, resource distribution, and QoS management are not ad-\\ndressed in this paper. In the current architecture implementation, each slicing is manually \\nconfigured using the functionalities provided by Open5GS. This tool supports slicing and \\nNFs creation by changing the configuration files of Open5GS, and a service restart is re-\\nquired to apply the new settings and NFs. \\nFigure 5 illustrates the simplified implemented architecture, which consists of differ-\\nent instances of VMs where in each client has a dedicated UERANSIM instance within a \\ndedicated VM, and their number is contingent on the number of clients. The core networks \\nof the operators were implemented in the same VM as the neutral host core, as the \\nOpen5GS does not require their separation. \\nTo demonstrate the development of the implemented architecture, highlighting the \\nconfiguration of virtual machines and the software used in interactions between different \\nparts of the system, a basic scenario was designed. This scenario considers both type s of \\nclients: operator and non-operator. Figure 5 presents the implemented system, as well as \\nthe VMs used and the interactions between them.

Results and Discussion \\nThis section describes the tests conducted to validate the architecture proposed in \\nthis paper, the results obtained, and the corresponding discussion. The results are split \\ninto three sections. The first one involves functional testing to check the MNO and non -\\nMNO authentication methods  and the traffic isolation of a network slice. Afterward, we \\nanalyze our proposal’s efficiency to share and manage the NSP resources by measuring \\nthe impact on CSPs and their users. These performance evaluation results are split into \\ntwo sections, one using the throughput and the other using the packet loss as metrics. In \\nthose tests, we use the maximum number of slices given our hardware limitations, which \\nare four slices, and use as the baseline an NSP with a single client, which corresponds to \\nhaving a single network slice with all the available resources. The performance evaluation \\nresults include the confidence intervals for a confidence level of 95%. \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/5G/2411.15505v1.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content=' \\n \\n4.1. Authentication and Traffic Isolation \\nIn order to validate the implemented architecture, the user authentication procedure \\nand the network slice traffic isolation were tested for both types of clients: operator and \\nnon-operator. A simple test scenario with the infrastructure shared by one operator client \\nand one non-operator client was designed, and we measured the user authentication time \\nand verified the traffic isolation among clients. \\nRegarding the authentication time for the two types of clients, 10 measurements were \\ntaken from a user of each client, the averages were calculated, and the difference was an-\\nalyzed. The average value obtained for the authentication of the operator -client user was \\n262.4 ms, and for the non-operator-client user, it was 239.9 ms. Thus, a slight difference in \\nthe authentication time of 22.5 ms was observed. This difference is a consequence of the \\nextra network hops in the authentication of the operator-client user as it requires the core \\nof its operator to authenticate it via roaming, while the non-operator-client user authenti-\\ncates directly on the neutral host CN. This time difference can become more significant \\naccording to the communication delay between the operator CN and the neutral host CN. \\nOpen5GS creates a tunnel interface for each slice, so to verify traffic isolation in each \\nslice, traffic was generated using iperf from two different users of different clients. On the \\ncore network side, tcpdump was used on each interface to monitor the traffic of each user. \\nThrough filters, we checked if the traffic passing through one user ’s interface also passed \\nthrough the other user’s interface. If it happened, it would indicate interference between \\nthe interfaces of each user. However, we observed that this was not the case, leading us to \\nconclude that each interface is specifically dedicated to each client, thus ensuring traffic \\nisolation between the slices. \\n4.2. Throughput \\nThis test, which used the evaluation scenario presented in Figure 6, measured the \\nmaximum throughput obtained in the utilization of the infrastructure and compared us-\\ning our neutral host architecture, sharing resources with a network slice per different cl i-\\nents, and using the neutral host infrastructure as a traditional network operator, i.e., one \\nclient/one slice serving its users. Given the resource limitations of our testing hardware, \\nwe limited the maximum number of clients to test in our proposed archi tecture to four, \\nresulting in four network slices. To overcome the limitations imposed by the VMs with \\nUERANSIM, and to make it a fair comparison between the two configurations, the users \\nwere distributed across the same number of different UERANSIM VMs both in the single \\nclient configuration and in the configuration with four clients. \\nThe user traffic was generated using the iperf tool [24] over TCP (transmission control \\nprotocol). The maximum throughput per user achieved with each configuration was \\nmeasured in periods of 60 s and with the parameter value of window size set to 416 kB. \\nThe values shown in the tables correspond to an average of 10 recorded values. In the \\ntables, the different IP (Internet protocol) addresses identify the different clients present \\nin the architecture. \\nTable 2 represents the maximum throughput per user and total throughput with \\neight users, illustrating the results obtained with the two different configurations de-\\nscribed before. In the first row, the eight users belong to the same client and are evenly \\ndistributed across four VMs, whereas in the second row, the eight users are evenly dis-\\ntributed across four different clients/slices and their respective VMs. Table 3 presents re-\\nsults from similar tests, but comprising only four users, one per each UERANSIM VM. \\n  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/5G/2411.15505v1.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content=' \\n \\nTable 2.

The \\nsame pattern can be observed in Table 3, with one user per VM. The increase in the total \\nthroughput was similar (61.8% in the first table and 61.7% in the second one). These results \\nshow that the proposed neutral host architecture has a positive impact on the user \\nthroughput. \\nComparing the results for the same configuration from both tables, we can see that  \\nfor both configurations, the total throughput is higher when there are only four users in \\nthe neutral host network instead of eight. This is expected since in the first case, two users \\nare competing for the processing resources of each UERANSIM VM compared with one \\nper VM in the second case. \\nTo better understand these results, the CPU usage was monitored during these ex-\\nperiments in the VM1, the neutral host CN. It was observed that in all cases, an individual \\nprocess was formed for each slice. In the configurations with only one slice, the CPU usage \\nincreased as the number of users increased but remained limited to a single process, re-\\nsulting in a maximum CPU usage that did not exceed 99%. In contrast, in the configura-\\ntions with four slices, four disti nct processes were generated, one for each slice. This ap-\\nproach allowed for a more efficient distribution of traffic among the different slices, re-\\nsulting in individualized CPU usage. As a result, the CPU usage was not restricted to a \\nsingle core but was distributed among the available cores in VM1. This led to an increase \\nin maximum throughput per user. \\n4.3. Packet Loss Ratio \\nThis section demonstrates the behavior of the neutral host network in terms of  the \\npacket loss of different clients. To measure the packet loss ratio, the user traffic generated \\nby the iperf tool, in this case, was over UDP ( user datagram protocol) since it does not \\nrecover from lost packets as TCP does. The throughput per user was selected based on the \\nmaximum feasible value that allowed  us to keep all eight users connected. The loss of \\nconnection for high loads that was observed while conducting these tests (and even failure \\nto connect in some cases) can be justified by limitations of the simulator and the available \\ncomputational resources. \\nTable 4 presents the packet loss ratio (PLR) experienced by the user connections with \\nthe maximum feasible throughput per user. Except for the fixed throughput per user and \\nthe use of UDP traffic, the configurations are similar to those used in Table 2. \\n  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/5G/2411.15505v1.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content=' \\n \\nTable 4. PLR and maximum feasible throughput per user with eight users distributed by four VMs \\nfor both configurations. \\n PLR (%) \\n VM2 VM3 VM4 VM5 \\nOne client/slice 1.11 ± 0.37 1.12 ± 0.38 1.10 ± 0.39 1.13 ± 0.41 1.06 ± 0.45 1.05 ± 0.44 1.19 ± 0.41 1.15 ± 0.39 \\nFour clients/slices 0.05 ± 0.05 0.04 ± 0.03 0.03 ± 0.03 0.03 ± 0.02 0.04 ± 0.04 0.04 ± 0.04 0.03 ± 0.02 0.03 ± 0.02 \\nAccording to these results, the proposed neutral host architecture experienced a \\nmean PLR 96.8% lower than the configuration with just one client (0.036%, on average, \\ncompared to 1.11%). To ensure a fair comparison, both configurations were tested with a \\nthroughput of 23.1 Mbps. \\nThus, similarly to what was observed with the throughput, the differentiation of pro-\\ncesses for each slice leads to better CPU distribution in the neutral host CN VM, resulting \\nin a positive impact on network performance in terms of packet loss per user com pared \\nto using only one slice. \\n5. Conclusions \\nThis paper explored the sharing of 5G infrastructure through the development of a \\nflexible and dynamic architecture that allows for the efficient provision of mobile network \\nservices to various types of clients, regardless of whether they are operators or not, while \\nensuring an efficient provision of the services and the isolation of each client ’s traffic. \\nThe complexity of the proposed architecture, coupled with limitations of the availa-\\nble open-source software tools and computational resources , led to some restrictions in \\nthe architecture implemented for validation of the proposed solution. \\nNevertheless, the tests performed in this work using the implemented neutral host \\narchitecture showed promising results, with successful validation of the different types of \\nauthentication and traffic isolation requirements, and a significantly better perf ormance \\n(higher throughput and lower PLR per user) of the proposed architecture based on net-\\nwork slicing and roaming when compared to the baseline test, i.e., a single client using all \\nthe available network resources. \\nReferences \\n1.

A high gain and \\nefficiency and low losses are major considerations which can be \\nachieved by the proposed design when compared to the substrate \\nintegrated waveguide slot antenna array.

INTRODUCTION\\nT\\nhe tremendous progress and advancement of wireless \\ncommunication networks have augmented the demands of \\navailable bandwidth to provide high data rates for the ever-\\nincreasing number of wireless users and applications. This \\ntrend has encouraged the researchers to look beyond lower \\nfrequency spectrum for future upgradation.  Millimetre-wave \\n(MMW) frequencies are anticipated as highly promising for the \\nrealization of next generation mobile networks (i.e. 5G) in \\norder to deliver high data throughput and better coverage [1, \\n2]. However, there are several challenges involved in the \\ndevelopment of such a system based on a number of factors . \\nFor instance, atmospheric attenuation and path losses become \\ncritically higher at these frequencies [3]. Also, the received \\nsignal power reduces at MMW frequencies as compared to \\nlower frequency bands due to smaller effective aperture size of \\nsingle element antenna. Therefore, in order to compensate \\nthese losses, the MMW communication systems are required to \\nincorporate high gain antenna arrays.  \\n The slotted waveguide antenna array could be a potential \\ncandidate due to a number of reasons such as, high gain profile, \\nhigh efficiency, lesser complexity of feed system, simplicity of \\nthe structure and accurate control over the radiation pattern \\ncharacteristics [4, 5]. Metallic rectangular waveguide (RWG) \\nare extensively investigated in this regard, though limited due \\nto its increased weight and fabrication cost. In order to deal \\nwith such issues substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) \\nstructure is developed, which depict the advantages of an ease \\nof fabrication and high level of integration for slot antenna \\narray [6, 7].  However, the key limitation in this scenario is the \\npresence of dielectric which increases the losses as compare to \\nconventional RWG, especially at higher frequencies [8]. The \\ndesired outcome would be to retain the advantages of RWG \\nwithout compromising the low profile structural characteristics \\nand low-cost fabrication suggested by SIW structures.  In order \\nto achieve this objective, a simple and low-cost structure is \\nproposed in [9], referred as an Empty Substrate Integrated \\nWaveguide (ESIW). ESIW structure is constructed by creating \\na void or aperture of rectangular shape in the geometry of a \\nplanar substrate. Moreover, the upper and lower surfaces as \\nwell as the lateral walls are metallized to create an empty-\\nwaveguide-like geometry. The results suggest much lower \\nlosses and improved Q-factor could be achieved in the devices \\nintegrated with this novel technique as compared to the \\nequivalent designs in SIW [9]. \\nIn this paper, a linear antenna array with four radiating slots \\nis designed. The purpose of this research is to designed an \\nintegrated waveguide slot antenna array and improve the \\nradiation efficiency as compared to SIW based slot antenna \\narray. The proposed design is evaluated based on numerical \\nsimulation. \\nII. PROPOSED ANTENNA DESIGN\\nT\\nhe proposed geometry of empty substrate integrated \\nwaveguide slot antenna array at designed frequency of 28 \\nGHz is presented in Fig. 1. Longitudinal slots etched on the \\nbroadside of the ESIW structure interrupt the transverse \\ncurrent flow that excite these slots and give rise to radiation. \\nThe ESIW structure is employed on Rogers 4003 substrate \\n(hESIW = 0.508 mm, permittivity ɛr = 3.55, and cladding \\nthickness t = 35 μm). The design procedure for the proposed \\nESIW structure is thoroughly demonstrated in [10] and same \\nparameters for Ka-band referred in [10] are implemented in \\nthis work as well.

The antenna design is \\npresented to deliver a low-loss and highly efficient \\nperformance at 28 GHz and also enhances the feasibility of \\npractical implementation in a cost-effective way with \\nrelatively lesser complexity involved in the planar design \\nmodelling and integration. The designed antenna suggests an \\noperating bandwidth of 10.4% (i.e. 26.5-29.4 GHz) with high \\ngain of 11.6 dBi at 28 GHz. Based on these features the \\nantenna is recommended as potential candidate to be \\nincorporated in future 5G applications. \\nREFERENCES \\n[1] J. G. Andrews et al., “What will 5G be?” IEEE J.

INTRODUCTION \\nThe amount of data transmission required today is \\nincreasing, and future transmission rates are expected to be \\neven faster. Through MIMO technology, different signals can \\nbe simultaneously processed, utilizing different antennas for \\ntransmission and reception at the same time. This effectively \\nmaximizes the use of time. Furthermore, multiple antennas \\nreceiving signals can be likened to multiple individuals \\ncooperating, increasing stability during reception. Recently, \\n5th generation wireless system has been promoted, using small \\ncell to create cellular network, and provides better connection \\nand higher throughput. Due to the high throughput we provide \\nto the user, multi-input multi-output antenna is needed to be \\nset into a small cell. For Wi-Fi applications including the 2.45 \\nGHz (2.4 –2.484 GHz) and 5 GHz (5.125–5.825 GHz) bands, \\nthe presented antenna designs have been reported in [1]–[7].  \\nHowever, the above antenna designs only focus on the Wi-Fi \\n6 band operation. Also, it is scant for the related antenna \\ndesigns applied to the Wi-Fi 6E / 7 bands. Simultaneously, \\nsmall cell must solve two big problems: heat from IC and \\nnoise from circuit. The high heat will affect CPU from \\nworking normally and high noise from circuit will reduce the \\nsignal-to noise level for the antenna radiation performance. \\nTherefore, in this article, referred to [8]-[9], the present work \\nproposes a Wi-Fi 6E / 7 patch antenna design for a small base \\nstation. To achieve high coverage, the design adopts a cellular \\nstructure, incorporating antennas applicable to Wi-Fi 6E / 7 \\nfrequency bands on each face. The antennas employ a patch \\nwith a pair of slits for bandwidth enhanced design. The goal is \\nto enhance the gain efficiency of individual antennas and \\nachieve optimal impedance matching. The design of multiple \\nantennas can be adjusted based on user space, ensuring \\noptimal coverage and stability. From the related measured \\nresults, it provides relatively wider impedance bandwidth to \\nmeet the specification of 2.38-2.44 GHz and 4.9-7.125 GHz \\nrequirement with the measured peak gains and antenna \\nefficiencies close to 6.4 / 10 / 8.6 dBi and 75 / 80 / 70 % for \\nthe 2.45 / 5.5 / 6.5 GHz bands, respectively. Also, to comply \\nwith the MIMO requirement, this work also analyzes the \\nmeasured ECC between two ports of the proposed MIMO \\nantenna. Details of the proposed antenna design are described \\nin this study, and the related results for the obtained \\nperformance operated across Wi-Fi 6E / 7 bands are presented \\nand discussed. This study describes the details of the proposed \\nantenna design and presents and discusses results related to \\nthe performance obtained operating in the Wi-Fi 6E / 7 bands. \\nII. ANTENNA DESIGN \\n Fig. 1 illustrates the geometry of the proposed Wi-Fi 6E / \\n7 multi-band patch antennas with MIMO operation in a small \\nbase station. In this study, the dual-band Wi-Fi 6E / 7 antenna \\nemploys a probe-fed circular patch to excite the fundamental \\nresonance mode at 2.4GHz ( TM11 mode) with a diameter of \\n56.9 mm. The slit alters the original current path, and high-\\norder modes at 4.6 GHz (\\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04), 5 GHz (\\x01\\x02\\x05\\x04) and 5.6 GHz \\n(\\x01\\x02\\x06\\x04) are also effectively excited due to the asymmetric slit, \\nwithout apparent weaknesses in radiation patterns. The \\ncircular patch antenna is etched on the FR4 substrate of \\ndielectric constant ε r = 4.7 and loss tangent tan δ = 0.0245. The \\nhollow characteristics of this work allow it to integrate with \\nmany active devices available on the market. Due to the design \\nof a large inner layer with extensive grounding, the external \\nantennas are protected from the impact of central circuit noise, \\nthereby achieving optimal performance. With the high-gain \\nadvantage of this work, even when placed in a small corner of \\nthe home, signal stability can be maintained. \\n \\n \\nFig. 1  Geometry of the proposed Wi-Fi 6E/7 multi-band antenna in a small \\nbase station. \\n979-8-3503-1475-5/24/$31.00 ©2024 IEEE 242\\n2024 IEEE International Workshop on Antenna Technology (iWAT) | 979-8-3503-1475-5/24/$31.00 ©2024 IEEE | DOI: 10.1109/iWAT57102.2024.10535867\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Univ of Calif Riverside.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \\nFirst, we used Ansys HFSS, an electromagnetic \\nsimulation software [10], in the design of the proposed Wi-Fi \\n6E / 7 antenna. Fig. 2 shows the related simulated and \\nexperimental return loss, with a standard of return loss ≤ 10 \\ndB (VSWR 2:1) for the proposed Wi-Fi 6E / 7 MIMO patch \\nantennas at port A and B. This antenna model covers the Wi-\\nFi 6E / 7 frequency bands of 2.38-2.44 GHz and 4.9-7.125 \\nGHz.

All rights reserved.  1 of 4 \\nIntroduction \\nConnected homes are replete with a variety of smart objects collectively known as the Home Internet of Things \\n(IoT). Due to Wi-Fi®’s ubiquity throughout the world, its wide-ranging technology portfolio, and its strong legacy of \\ninteroperability, Wi-Fi is certain to play a role in almost every Home IoT environment. The nature of Home IoT is that \\na wide range of products, manufactured by different companies, need to work in unison. Wi-Fi is designed for \\ninteroperability at its core by adhering to IEEE standards, and as such, it offers pervasive connectivity across control \\ndevices, like smartphones, as well as access points (APs) and connected objects. Personal data exchanged through \\nthe Home IoT network is safe with Wi-Fi due to its inherent security protocols, and the high performance that Wi-Fi \\noffers ensures that IoT devices remain consistently connected and operational, which is especially important for \\nhigh-stakes situations such as eldercare. \\nWi-Fi Alliance® offers Wi-Fi CERTIFIED® testing and certification \\nto ensure interoperability with other Wi-Fi CERTIFIED devices. \\nWhile companies may create products based on the IEEE 802.11 \\nstandard that are not certified, they do not carry the Wi-Fi brand \\nor certification logo. This is a serious detriment to a product’s \\ncredibility as the Wi-Fi CERTIFIED seal of approval means that a \\nproduct has been tested in a variety of ways to validate its \\nquality and reliability. Certification is especially important for IoT \\ndevices as they often must interoperate with numerous \\nproducts in order to provide the Home IoT experience that \\nhomeowners and renters are looking for. Wi-Fi CERTIFIED also \\nbenefits device vendors by giving confidence to consumers, \\nsolution integrators, and service providers that products \\nperform well and are backward compatible with earlier versions \\nof Wi-Fi. In addition to the many benefits of Wi-Fi CERTIFIED \\ndescribed above, it is also a mandatory requirement for Matter \\ncertification, which further ensures device compatibility. \\nWi-Fi Alliance offers certification for over 20 technology programs, many of which offer specific advantages for \\nHome IoT. These certification programs can be categorized as core Wi-Fi connectivity or additional Wi-Fi capabilities: \\n• Power saving features: Innovations that increase Wi-Fi device power efficiency  \\n• Core Wi-Fi connectivity: Certification programs based on specific key versions of the IEEE 802.11 \\nconnectivity standard, each of which incorporates a range of technical features and capabilities  \\n• Additional Wi-Fi capabilities: Certification programs that optimize Wi-Fi networks or support particular \\napplications and services. These programs offer capabilities such as advanced security, easier onboarding, \\ninteroperable meshes, and integration/coexistence with other network technologies \\nPower saving features  \\nAlways innovating and evolving, Wi-Fi is now even better suited for battery-powered applications. Wi-Fi Alliance has \\nintroduced additional power saving features as a part of Wi-Fi CERTIFIED programs that enable devices to benefit \\nfrom native connectivity to Wi-Fi networks and the Internet without concern for power consumption. Power saving \\nfeatures can drastically increase battery life for Wi-Fi enabled devices in smart home, smart city, industrial, and \\nhealthcare environments. \\n• Longer sleep periods: Devices stay asleep longer while remaining associated with the network \\n• Improved network efficiency: Network traffic and exchanges to keep devices connected are drastically \\nreduced \\n• Extended battery life: Mechanisms in APs enable lower-power operation for all connected devices \\n• Easily applicable: Features may be delivered to networks, including existing networks, via software update \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Optimizing_Home_IoT_with_Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_20241104.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance. All rights reserved.  2 of 4 \\nCore Wi-Fi connectivity  \\nCore Wi-Fi connectivity is the basis for IoT devices to connect to a home network and ultimately to internet \\napplications. Wi-Fi Alliance has introduced simple numerical designators to identify major Wi-Fi connectivity \\nreleases, such as Wi-Fi 6, and its associated certification program, Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 6®. This enables each major \\nrelease to combine both the new, better-performing radio protocol standards for enhanced capacity, range, latency, \\netc., as well as certain other foundational and mandatory capabilities, such as WPA3™ security. From a Home IoT \\nperspective, newer generation technologies offer capabilities that go beyond raw throughput speed. It is worth \\nnoting that the addition of 6 GHz to Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 6 is a special case, as it marks the point at which a whole new \\nspectrum band became applicable. In addition to the major Wi-Fi releases, Wi-Fi also offers application-specific Wi-Fi \\nconnectivity, such as Wi-Fi CERTIFIED HaLow™, providing long range, low-power Wi-Fi in the sub-gigahertz spectrum. \\nWi-Fi 7 \\nWi-Fi 7, based on IEEE 802.11be technology, is the latest Wi-Fi standard that enhances Wi-Fi performance in the \\n2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands, bringing cutting-edge capabilities to enable innovations that require high \\nthroughput, lower latency, and greater reliability across home, enterprise, and industrial environments. As video \\nuse cases gain prevalence in the home, Wi-Fi 7 supports ultra-high definition video streaming and conferencing and \\nkey AR/VR/XR applications that provide immersive, interactive experiences including social gaming. Wi-Fi 7 delivers \\nextremely high throughputs, low latency, and low jitter by leveraging new features that support wideband, high-\\nspeed communication with more nimble and robust use of spectrum in the presence of interference. The newest \\nproducts are also starting to adopt Wi-Fi 7 to access the 6 GHz band, which is being released (with a few different \\nrules and frequency widths) in many regulations around the world. Wi-Fi in 6 GHz can support faster speeds using \\nlarger channel widths that bring extra capacity to the Wi-Fi universe with relatively low interference and congestion. \\nInitial APs and devices appeared during 2021, with the total number of devices certified for 6 GHz exceeding 1,300 \\nin mid-2024. While the initial targets for 6 GHz devices are mostly at the high end (for instance, laptops and top-tier \\nsmartphones), it is also suitable for high-throughput IoT devices such as video-based fitness machines, security \\ncameras, and telemedicine products. \\nWi-Fi 7 offers significant advancements that balance high performance with reduced power consumption, \\naddressing the growing user demand for high-throughput, low-latency applications. One of its key features, Multi-\\nlink Operation (MLO), allows devices to combine different channels across frequency bands together, enabling \\nconcurrent transmission and reception of data over multiple links for increased efficiency. This flexibility optimizes \\nboth performance and power usage based on network conditions. Additionally, Wi-Fi 7’s use of 4K QAM and \\nMultiple Resource Units to a single STA enhances data transmission rates and efficiency, both of which are crucial \\nfor power-saving. These features make Wi-Fi 7 particularly beneficial for battery-operated devices in automotive and \\nIndustrial IoT applications, where efficient power usage is essential for extending operational life and reducing \\nmaintenance costs. \\nInitially introduced in Wi-Fi 6, Target Wake Time (TWT) assists in delivering extended battery life and reduced power \\nconsumption by allowing a device to “sleep” for extended periods of time between connections to the network, \\nrather than being permanently connected. Wi-Fi 7 has expanded on this feature with Restricted Target Wake Time \\n(R-TWT). R-TWT allows client devices to effectively reserve a channel, scheduling specific times for their own use. \\nThis further enhances power efficiency, a crucial component of the operational life of IoT devices. \\nWi-Fi 6 and 6 GHz \\nBased on the IEEE 802.11ax standard, Wi-Fi 6 operates in the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz frequency bands. Wi-Fi 6 \\nprovides greater capacity, multi-gigabit data rates, better power efficiency, and high performance even in densely \\npopulated environments. Wi-Fi 6 has mostly been deployed in mid-to-high end APs, primarily where ISPs have ultra-\\nhigh speed broadband offers of 300 Mbps or above, such as FTTx fiber or DOCSIS3+ generations of cable. Some 5G \\nfixed wireless access (FWA) modems also use Wi-Fi 6 for in-home connectivity.  \\nOn the device side, Wi-Fi 6 and 6 GHz are now fairly common in mid-to-high end laptops, mid-tier smartphones, and \\nother devices such as certain TVs and gaming consoles.  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Optimizing_Home_IoT_with_Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_20241104.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance. All rights reserved.  3 of 4 \\nWi-Fi 6 is particularly relevant when devices have high bandwidth or low latency requirements such as cameras and \\nscreens, but there are also additional benefits around power consumption and reliability. Wi-Fi 6 contains a number \\nof features that have significant benefits for Home IoT applications, with Target Wake Time (TWT) being one of the \\nmost influential in terms of power saving. TWT allows a device to “sleep” for extended periods of time between \\nconnections to the network rather than being permanently connected. APs and end devices negotiate and pre-\\nschedule timing – either individually or in groups – which is key for extending battery life and reducing power \\nconsumption. Additional features include multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MU-MIMO), beamforming, \\nand basic service set (BSS) coloring. Wi-Fi 6 also mandates WPA3 security mechanisms. \\nWi-Fi 4  \\nWi-Fi 4 is the “baseline” for modern Wi-Fi networks. Wi-Fi CERTIFIED™ n is based on the 802.11n standard originally \\npublished in 2009, and can operate in both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands and provides good coverage across the home \\nfor devices that do not require extensive bandwidth, such as smart thermostats and connected lighting. Owing to its \\nstability and relatively low cost, it is still widely used today in many IoT devices as well as some wearables and smart \\ntelevisions. Its power saving features are also particularly valuable for IoT devices, which require long battery life \\nand may not need to communicate with infrastructure too frequently. \\nWi-Fi HaLow™ \\nWi-Fi HaLow is the first version of Wi-Fi \\nspecifically designed for the IoT marketplace, \\nwith longer range and lower power connectivity \\nthan other Wi-Fi connectivity technologies. It \\nhas applications for Home IoT as well as \\nenterprises, agriculture, and smart cities. Based \\non IEEE 802.11ah technology, it operates in \\nunlicensed spectrum below 1 GHz using \\nnarrowband channels. The exact bands vary by \\nregion of the world but are the same \\nfrequencies used for other low-power wide-\\narea network (LPWAN) technologies such as LoRa and SigFox. \\nIn the context of Home IoT, the ability to penetrate walls and other barriers better than 2.4 GHz technologies is an \\nimportant consideration. Wi-Fi HaLow implements new sleep and management modes (using the same TWT \\nprotocol outlined above) to deliver energy-efficient, multi-year battery operation. This makes it suitable for \\nconnecting devices such as door locks, lighting, cameras, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) \\ncomponents. It can also link appliances to each other or to Internet resources without running additional signaling \\nwires. Home doorbells or multi-dwelling unit (MDU) access control systems can use Wi-Fi HaLow’s higher data rates \\nto support real-time video and biometric authentication schemes.  \\nSimilar to Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7, Wi-Fi HaLow is underpinned by modern security protocols, including WPA3 and Wi-Fi \\nCERTIFIED Enhanced Open™. For Home IoT applications, these protocols encrypt valuable or confidential data sent \\nbetween IoT devices and the AP. The comparatively higher data rates also allow for additional security layers, such \\nas tunneled IP traffic sent to trusted cloud platforms. Firmware updates can be downloaded quickly and securely via \\nover-the-air refresh, improving functionality and security without extra user intervention. \\nWPA3 \\nWPA3 is now a mandatory certification for all devices.

Program features enable IP data flows to be classified, \\nmapped to one of the quality of service ( QoS) access categories defined by WMM®, and scheduled appropriately. \\nThis helps ensure that traffic for real-time applications and services is inserted into queues with higher priority \\nand (when available) scheduled according to each flow’s characteristics and QoS  key performance indicators \\n(KPIs), resulting in a better experience for end users.  \\nWi-Fi QoS Management is an ideal complement to Wi-Fi 7 because it helps manage the  use of Wi-Fi 7’s key \\nfeatures, such as Multi-Link Operation (MLO) and Multiple Resource Units (M-RU), to robustly achieve the QoS \\nKPIs required for each flow. For example, once the necessary prioritization and KPIs for a flow with stringent QoS \\nrequirements have been exchanged using Wi -Fi QoS Management features , the flow can be intelligently \\nscheduled across all available MLO links with flexible M-RU resource allocation. This facilitates reduc tion of  \\nchannel access delay  and improvement in  link capacity, particularly in the presence of interference or congestion, \\nto help ensure the flow’s KPIs are met.  \\nWi-Fi technology is used for an expanding range of applications and \\nservices with a variety of QoS requirements. All of these benefit from \\nhigher throughput and lower latency . Some services, such as video \\nstreaming, use large playback buffers to help tolerate short -term \\nvariations in link quality, but still require a minimum average throughput \\nto avoid service interruption. More advanced services that rely on real-\\ntime interactions via audio and video — such as voice-over-IP (VoIP), \\nonline gaming, enterprise videoconferencing, live streaming, and AR/VR—\\nhave higher demands to avoid latency and jitter and require high \\ninstantaneous throughput to deliver a quality experience. Good service \\ndelivery entails consistently applied QoS treatment policies that deliver \\nreliable service even when the Wi-Fi environment experiences dynamic \\nchanges, such as peaks in traffic demand and interference.  The Wi-Fi QoS \\nManagement™ certification program delivers a consistent, end-to-end \\nQoS treatment in Wi-Fi networks, providing robust service delivery  and \\nquality experiences in real -time applications. \\nThis paper provides a detailed technical overview of the features of the \\nWi-Fi QoS Management  program, their applica bility to use cases, and  \\nimplementation considerations . \\n  \\nKey Capabilities  \\n• Leverages QoS-aware capabilities to \\nbring quality end-to-end connectivity \\n• Extends features of WMM for \\nsimplified QoS traffic categorization \\nand prioritization \\n• Utilizes mirrored QoS and flow \\nclassifiers to enable client devices to \\nrequest prioritization of IP data flows \\n• Gives network managers the ability to \\napply QoS policies to IP data flows  \\nBenefits \\n• Delivers a consistent, end-to-end \\napproach to QoS management in Wi-Fi \\nnetworks  \\n• Brings greater quality service in \\nlatency-sensitive applications used in \\nresidential, public, and enterprise \\nsettings \\n• Provides noticeable improvement to \\nquality of experience for users \\n• Complements and provides benefits \\nfor all Wi-Fi generations '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_QoS_Management_Technology_Overview_202401.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance.

The program \\ncomprises four main features, which are based on capabilities defined in IEEE Std 802.11-2020 and the 802.11ax-\\n2021 and 802.11be amendments: \\n• Mirrored Stream Classification Service (MSCS)  enables a client device to manage AP QoS treatment of \\ndownlink IP flows using QoS mirroring  \\n• Stream Classification Service (SCS) enables a client device to manage AP treatment of downlink IP data \\nflows based on IP tuple and IPsec child security association ( SA) classifiers, and , for Wi-Fi 6 and Wi -Fi 7 \\ndevices, of uplink IP data flows based on traffic identifier (TID) \\n• Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP) mapping enables a network manager to configure mapping \\ntables between the DSCP marking in IP packet headers and the over-the-air QoS treatment on both APs \\nand client devices  \\n• DSCP Policy enables the network to manage a client device’s treatment of uplink IP flows using DSCP \\nmarking policies  \\nThese features leverage WMM, which is based on IEEE 802.11 QoS mechanisms. To best understand the benefits \\nprovided by Wi-Fi QoS Management , it is important to become familiar with the basics of the WMM program.  \\nWMM certification program background  \\nThe Wi-Fi ecosystem already has ubiquitous support for  WMM, which adopted the four QoS access categories \\nestablished in  the IEEE 802.11 standard: Voice, Video,  Best Effort, and Background. These categories are used to \\nprioritize traffic, both in terms of over -the-air channel access and transmit queuing. The Wi -Fi QoS Management \\nprogram builds on WMM by enabling both APs and client devices to request identified IP flows to be assigned to \\nan access category for specific QoS treatment.  \\nThe baseline mechanism provided by WMM 1 enables prioritized, differentiated QoS treatment based on \\nenhanced distributed channel access ( EDCA). Prioritized and differentiated QoS refers to the prioritization of data \\nflows with respect to each other. Prioritized QoS provides an appropriate baseline for Wi-Fi networks because it \\nis scalable, does not require prediction of traffic patterns, and is effective even when networks experience \\ndynamic changes in data rate, channel load , and interference. \\nWMM access categories \\nThe four WMM access categories, presented in order of channel access priority, are: \\n• Voice   \\n• Video  \\n• Best effort \\n• Background \\nThese access categories provide differentiated QoS treatment through independent transmit queues and unique \\nchannel access parameters. \\n \\n1\\n For additional information about WMM, see https://www.wi -fi.org/discover-wi-fi/wi-fi-certified -wmm-programs  \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_QoS_Management_Technology_Overview_202401.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance. All rights reserved.  3 of 20 \\nTransmit queues \\nEach of the four access categories includes \\ntwo User Priority (UP) levels and has its \\nown independent transmit queue, as \\nshown in Figure 1. This means that when \\nthe transmitting device is queueing a \\nmixture of data packets assigned to \\ndifferent access categories, high  priority \\ndata packets reach the front of the queue \\nfor transmission, even when other lower  \\npriority data packets are already pending \\ntransmission. This minimizes latency \\ncaused by “head -of-line blocking ,” where \\nthe first packet holds up the remaining \\npackets in a queue, within the transmitting \\ndevice. Since the receiving device handles \\nin-order delivery of packets for each UP \\nindividually, high priority data packets received with a given UP are made available to applications without delay, \\neven when previously transmitted packets assigned to other UPs are pending successful retransmission.  \\nUnique channel access parameters \\nEach access category is associated with a set of EDCA parameters : contention window minimum ( CWmin), \\ncontention window maximum  (CWmax), arbitration interframe space number  (AIFSN), and transmission opportunity  \\n(TXOP) limit. As shown in Figure 2, these access parameters influence the backoff delay before a device contends for \\nthe medium to transmit a data packet from the corresponding queue.  \\nBy default, the Voice access \\ncategory has the highest statistical \\npriority to gain access to the \\nchannel, but the maximum \\nduration of a single channel access \\nis relatively short, since it is \\nintended for low -bandwidth, low \\nlatency applications. The Video, \\nBest Effort, and Background \\naccess categories have — in that \\norder — relatively lower statistical \\nchannel access priority by default, \\nbut the maximum duration of a \\nsingle channel access is longer \\nsince they are intended for higher \\nbandwidth applications. This statistically prioritized channel access applies internally within a device between access \\ncategories transmitted by that device. Such prioritization also applies  between different Wi -Fi devices that are \\nsharing the channel using the same mechanism  — including between devices in different basic service sets ( BSSs) \\nand/or networks.  \\nUser Priority \\nA device transmitting an IP packet assigns its access category based on the packet’s UP, using the fixed mapping \\ntable defined by WMM , replicated in Table 1  below. A packet’s UP needs to be determined based on the higher \\nlayer QoS requirements of the application or service.  \\nFigure 1: Transmitter data path with WMM access categories  \\nFigure 2: Backoff delay for channel access with WMM access categories  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_QoS_Management_Technology_Overview_202401.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance.

However, t here are many scenarios in which  the appropriate DSCP marking is not, \\nor cannot, be applied. Wi-Fi QoS Management addresses these scenarios with features such as MSCS, SCS and \\nDSCP Policy. In addition, implementation diversity in the industry has resulted in inconsistent mapping of DSCP \\nvalues to UPs. Wi-Fi QoS Management addresses this incons istency by standardizing the default DSCP mapping . \\n \\n  User Priority Access Category \\n6 or 7 Voice (VO) \\n4 or 5 Video (VI) \\n0 or 3 Best Effort (BE)  \\n1 or 2 Background (BK) \\nTable 1: UP to WMM access category mapping  \\n \\nWMM with multi-user and scheduled access \\nWMM access categories are the fundamental basis of channel access for all Wi -Fi generations, including Wi -Fi 6 and \\nWi-Fi 7. When the advanced multiple access technologies  of Wi-Fi 6 and Wi -Fi 7, such as orthogonal frequency \\ndivision multiple access (OFDMA) and multi -user, multiple -input, multiple -output (MU -MIMO) are also used, the \\nassignment of data flows to WMM access categories also influences how those data flows are aggregated and \\nscheduled for transmission. With these technologies, the AP’s scheduler can facilitate transmission of  both downlink \\nand uplink flows — the latter by utilizing trigger-based uplink access.  \\nWith Wi-Fi 7’s MLO feature, packets of a given flow can be transmitted over any or all of the links enabled \\nbetween the AP and  station (STA). All QoS Management features are managed and executed at the  multi-link \\ndevice (MLD) layer. However, WMM’s underlying EDCA parameters (Cwmin/max, AIFSN,  and TXOP Limit) are \\ndefined for each link separately.  \\nWi-Fi QoS Management features \\nWi-Fi QoS Management provide s new and convenient mechanisms for application and service QoS requirements \\nto be signaled and negotiated, as well as mechanisms to ensure the mapping of DSCP values to UPs are \\nconsistently applied and managed.  A detailed discussion of the features follows.   \\nMirrored Stream Classification Service   \\nWi-Fi QoS Management APs and client devices are required to support MSCS, as defined in IEEE 802.11 -2020. \\nMSCS provides a simple means for a client device to request its AP to assign downlink IP flows destined to that \\nclient device to the desired access categories. MSCS is based on the concept of “mirrored ,” or “reflective,” QoS, \\nwhere the AP derives QoS rules for downlink IP flows by monitoring the corresponding uplink IP flows sent by the \\nclient device. The AP does t his by monitoring the IP header and the UP value in the 802.11 MAC header .  \\nMSCS is designed for situations where the downlink IP flows that ingress the AP do not have appropriate DSCP \\nmarking, and therefore simple DSCP -to-UP Mapping does not achieve the required QoS prioritization on the Wi -Fi \\nlink. Lack of appropriate DSCP marking is a frequent scenario for downlink IP flows that originate on the public \\ninternet since it is common for intermediate nodes or  internet service providers  (ISPs) to reset to zero or modify \\nany DSCP marking that might have been set by the source server.  \\nAs described in the section below, the procedure to activate MSCS is simple and lightweight . This involves a single \\nrequest/response exchange to negotiate the MSCS parameters , which is done  either at association or at any time \\npost-association. Unlike some alternative approaches, the client device does not need to request QoS treatment \\nfor each flow individually and does not need to determine an IP tuple classifier  for each IP flow. Therefore, MSCS '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_QoS_Management_Technology_Overview_202401.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance.

APs also indicate support  for \\nMSCS in Beacon and Probe Response frames.  \\nMSCS setup procedures \\nMSCS activation is always initiated by the client device, either by sending an MSCS Request frame to the AP post -\\nassociation, or — if supported by the client device  — sending a request embedded in a (Re)Association Request \\nframe at association time. In either case, the request frame contains an MSCS Descriptor element which specifies \\nthe parameters below.  \\nRequest Type \\nThe Request Type is s et to “add” when the client device is requesting activation of MSCS, or to “ change” when \\nthe client device is requesting modification of MSCS parameters when MSCS is already activated, or to \\n“remove” to deactivate MSCS . \\nUser Priority Bitmap  \\nThe UP Bitmap indicates a list of UPs — in the range 0 to 7 — which are to be monitored by the AP in received \\nuplink packets to determine downlink QoS rules . \\nTypically, a client device would set this bitmap to indicate UPs 4, 5, 6, and 7 only , which corresponds to the \\nVideo and Voice access categories. This is done  so that the AP generates downlink QoS rules based on uplink \\nIP flows that the client device sends in Video and Voice access categories but  does not generate rules for \\nuplink IP flows that are sent using Best Effort or Background access categories. This helps avoid excessive \\nprocessing overhead on the AP, for instance, where the AP would generate unnecessary rules corresponding \\nto downlink Best Effort and Background IP flows that do not require special QoS treatment.  \\nIn use cases where the client device also wants certain downlink IP flows to be deprioritized, the client device \\nmight also include UPs 1 and 2, the Background access category, in the bitmap and use those UPs when \\nsending the corresponding uplink IP flows.  \\nUser Priority Limit \\nThe UP Limit indicates a maximum limit for the UP values that the AP applies in downlink QoS rules . Typically, \\na client device sets this value to 7 , which is the highest possible UP value, so that all UPs in the bitmap are \\nmirrored as-is. There may be cases  where a lower limit is negotiated. For example, an enterprise network \\nmight have a network policy that allows MSCS mirroring only up to UP 5, the Video access category, to \\npreserve Voice for predetermined mission -critical business applications. In such a case, QoS rules generated \\nby the AP based on uplink IP flows sent using UP 6 or 7 would be capped and assigned to UP 5.  \\nStream timeout \\nStream timeout indicates a minimum period of time for which the AP is required to maintain a downlink QoS \\nrule, from the time at which the rule was generated or most recently updated . Typically, a client device sets \\nthis value to 60 seconds or less, so that the AP implementation can efficiently delete downlink QoS rules \\npertaining to IP flows that are no longer active.  \\nIn general, AP implementations are expected to maintain downlink QoS rules corresponding to downlink IP \\nflows that are currently active. If an AP does delete a rule for a downlink IP flow that is still active, then the \\nsubsequent reception of a packet in the corresponding uplink IP flow from the client device will cause the AP \\nto generate a new rule for that downlink flow.

All rights reserved.  6 of 20 \\nTraffic classification ( TCLAS) Mask element \\nThe TCLAS Mask element i ndicates a list of IP header fields that the AP is to use to define a downlink QoS rule . \\nA client device sets the frame classifier type in the TCLAS Mask element to 4 , indicating IP and higher layer \\nparameters. The device then typically sets the Classifier Mask bitmap to indicate the QoS rules are to be \\ndefined based on the full IP 5 -tuple (Source and Destination IP Address and Ports, and Protocol / Next \\nHeader). The same list applies for both IPv4 and IPv6 flows . The TCLAS Mask element does not specify the \\nactual IP tuple values for any particular flow; it simply specifies the list of IP header fields that are used to \\nuniquely identify and classify each flow.  \\nIn some use cases, an alternative TCLAS Mask parameter list might be beneficial. For example, if applications \\non the client device intend to create a large number of short -lived connections to the same remote IP address \\nand port using different local ports, and the uplink UP for all those connections is the same, then the client \\ndevice might omit Destination Port from the list in the TCLAS Mask element in order to help minimize the \\nnumber of downlink QoS rules generated by the AP.  \\nThe client device must ensure that the UP used when transmitting uplink packets that the AP will consider part of \\nthe same uplink IP flow does not rapidly fluctuate on a packet -to-packet basis . O therwise, the UP assigned to the \\ncorresponding downlink QoS rule will be unstable.  The client device should specify TCLAS Mask parameters that \\nare specific enough to avoid such instability.  \\nIf the AP accepts the request from the client device, it activates MSCS for that client device , or updates the MSCS \\nparameters if already activated . It then responds by including an MSCS Descriptor element indicating “success” in \\nthe (Re)Association Response frame , if requested at association, or indicating Success in an MSCS Response frame , \\nif requested post -association. The AP maintains the MSCS state for each client device individually , meaning the \\nnegotiated MSCS parameters and generated downlink QoS rules are specific to each client device.  \\nIf the AP does not accept the request, it provides a status code that might indicate the reason for rejection , such as  \\ninsufficient processing resources, or unsupported TCLAS Mask parameters . The AP then  optionally specifies an \\nalternative set of MSCS parameters that it would be prepared to accept.  For example, if the client device requests a \\nUP Limit of 7 but the network policy only allows MSCS mirroring up to UP 5, the AP might indicate a UP Limit of 5 in \\nits rejection response. Then, if the client device still wants to activate MSCS, it can send a new request in which the \\nrequested UP Limit is 5. \\nIf network policies completely prohibit the use of MSCS , perhaps because the policy requires DSCP-to-UP Mapping \\nto be strictly applied to all downlink IP flows, the AP might reject MSCS requests. However, if the network policies \\nonly specify QoS treatment for certain IP flows  but not for other IP flows , it is possible for those policies to coexist \\nwith MSCS. In such a case, the AP might accept the MSCS request  made by a client and continue to  abide by the \\nnetwork policies for those specific flows , while using the MSCS rules to  set the UP for other downlink IP flows.  \\nMSCS termination procedures and roaming \\nAn AP or client device can terminate an active MSCS at any time. An AP terminates MSCS with a client device by \\nsending an unsolicited MSCS Response frame to that client device, including a status code value that might \\nindicate the reason for the termination . Examples of termination reasons include exhausted processing \\nresources due to an excessive number of QoS rules generated  or insufficient network capacity to support the \\nQoS rules generated. A client device terminates MSCS by sending an MSCS Request frame with R equest Type set \\nto “remove.”  \\nAny active MSCS between an AP and client device  is implicitly terminated at such time that the client device is no \\nlonger associated with the AP, or reassociates with the same AP. While it is possible that some network \\narchitectures might exchange MSCS QoS rules between APs when a client device roams  — or potentially derive \\nnetwork-wide QoS policies based on MSCS rules  — in general it should not be expected that MSCS rules or state s \\npropagate beyond a single BSS  (or, for a Wi-Fi 7 case, a single AP MLD) .

This applies regardless of whether the target BSS is operated by the same physical AP , \\nexcept for a Wi-Fi 7 case where MSCS applies to all links of an ML association . Downlink IP flows are not assigned \\nthe expected UP immediately after a roam until the client device has sent at least one packet to the target BSS in \\nthe corresponding uplink IP flow so that the AP can generate the corresponding rule. \\nMSCS rule derivation \\nOnce MSCS is activated at the AP for a given client device, the AP monitors the uplink packets received from that \\nclient device. UPs are indicated in the TID subfield of the QoS Control field of the 802.11 MAC header. If an \\nindividually addressed unicast QoS Data frame containing an IP packet is received from the client device with a \\nUP that matches a value in the UP Bitmap, the AP generates or updates a corresponding downlink QoS rule by \\nextracting the values of  IP header fields from that received packet, as specified in the TCLAS Mask . \\nConsider the case where the MSCS parameters negotiated with the client device are as follows:  \\n• UP Bitmap = {4, 5, 6, 7}  \\n• UP Limit = 5 \\n• TCLAS Mask = { IP Version, Source IP Address, Destination IP Address, Source Port, Destination Port, \\nProtocol / Next Header}  \\nWhen the AP receives the uplink QoS Data frame shown in Figure 3 from that client device, where the indicated  \\nUP in the QoS Control field is 7, it generates a downlink QoS rule as follows:  \\n{IPver=4; SrcIPAddr=WAN_IPADDR; DstIPAddr=STA_IPADDR; SrcPort=WAN_PORT; DstPort=STA_PORT; \\nProtNxtHdr=6} ➔ UP=5 \\nThe Destination IP Address and Port in the received uplink frame are used as the Source IP Address and Port in \\nthe downlink QoS rule classifier, and vice versa. The UP assigned to the rule is determined as the minimum of the \\nUP of the uplink packet (7) and the negotiated UP Limit (5). \\n \\nFigure 3: Example of an IEEE 802.11 QoS Data frame containing an IP packet sent by a client device to an AP  \\nIf another uplink packet with the same IP tuple values is received, the UP of that packet is used to update the UP \\nassigned to the rule, if it is different to the rule’s current UP assignment. This means that the client device can \\ncause the AP to dynamically modify the QoS treatment of a downlink IP flow simply by changing the UP— or, \\nindirectly, the DSCP marking — of the corresponding uplink IP flow it transmits. \\nAP implementations can use various optimizations to minimize packet processing overhead and the number of \\nrules generated, such as:  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_QoS_Management_Technology_Overview_202401.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance.

If \\nthe downlink IP packet matches a TCLAS classifier associated with  a traffic stream or SCS rule (see Stream \\nClassification section), it also takes precedence for UP assignment over MSCS QoS rules. Note this does not apply \\nto any traffic streams negotiated for WMM-Admission Control or WMM-Power Save, since they are not associated \\nwith TCLAS classifiers. If those higher  precedence rules do not apply to the downlink IP packet and it matches an \\nMSCS rule, then the AP assigns the UP specified in the rule to that packet. If the downlink IP packet does not \\nmatch any of the above policies or rules, by default its UP will be assigned based on DSCP mapping .

Even if the transfer of user data is essentially downlink  only, any uplink packet sent to \\nestablish or maintain the TCP session, such as  synchronize ( SYN) or acknowledge (ACK), is sufficient for the AP to \\ngenerate the correct downlink IP rule, as long as it is sent using the appropriate UP. \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_QoS_Management_Technology_Overview_202401.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance.

This is so that the initial packets it transmits to the remote peer will \\ncause its local firewall to accept and forward packets subsequently received from the remote peer. The flows in \\nboth directions will have symmetric IP addresses and ports, and  the initial outbound VoIP packets are sufficient \\nfor the AP to generate the correct rule for QoS treatment of the inbound downlink VoIP packets from the peer \\nusing MSCS. \\nIn the case of virtual private network ( VPN) connections — such as using IPsec — TCP or UDP encapsulation is \\noften used to facilitate NAT traversal, and the outer IP addresses and ports are typically symmetric. In many \\ncases, the VPN client uses a constant UP to send all uplink VPN packets , irrespective of the nature of the payload  \\nor any DSCP marking on inner IP headers within the VPN tunnel. For example, if the VPN is primarily carrying \\nvideo traffic, the VPN client might use UP 4 or 5, or the Video access category, to send all uplink VPN packets . In \\nthis case, if MSCS is activated, the corresponding downlink VPN packets would also be sent using the same UP \\nand access category. \\nAlternatively, if the VPN client dynamically changes the UP used to send the uplink VPN packets on a packet -to-\\npacket basis, then downlink UP assignment based on MSCS rules would result in instability in the QoS treatment \\nof the downlink VPN packets . In such cases, it is recommended that SCS rules are activated to assign constant UP \\nvalues (see Stream Classification Service section) . Another  possible option is to establish multiple VPN \\nconnections to carry each of the inner flows with different QoS requirements. If the IP 5-tuple of each VPN \\nconnection is non-identical, the QoS treatment of the downlink packets for each VPN connection can be managed \\nusing MSCS. \\nNote that, in use cases where the VPN endpoints perform (outer) DSCP marking and that marking is preserved \\nend-to-end across the network, DSCP mapping can be used to assign the UP without using either MSCS or SCS.  \\nStream Classification Service (SCS)  \\nWi-Fi QoS Management APs and client devices optionally support SCS, as defined in IEEE 802.11 -2020 and \\nextended in IEEE 802.11be. \\nFor downlink flows, SCS is similar to MSCS in the sense that it also allows a client device to request its AP to \\nassign downlink IP flows destined to that client device to the desired access categories. However, whereas with \\nMSCS the AP implicitly derives QoS rules by monitoring the corresponding uplink IP flows, with SCS the request \\nfrom the STA explicitly provides the AP with the IP classifier and UP for each downlink IP flow.  MSCS and SCS are \\ncomplementary and designed to be used independently or together. SCS can be used to specify QoS rules for \\ncertain downlink IP flows that MSCS does not address — for example, downlink flows for which  there is no \\ncorresponding uplink flow with symmetric addresses/ports, or downlink flows that require different QoS \\ntreatment but have the same IP 5 -tuple, and so need to be classified based  on additional IP header parameters. \\nSCS also allows traffic characteristics (e.g. , traffic data rate and burst size) and QoS KPIs (e.g. , latency bound) to \\nbe specified by the client device  in its request as inputs to the AP’s downlink scheduler.  \\nFor uplink flows, SCS allows a Wi -Fi 6 or Wi -Fi 7 client device to request its Wi -Fi 6 or Wi -Fi 7 AP to schedule \\nresources using trigger frames. The request includes the traffic characteristics and QoS KPIs of the flow, as well \\nas the required cadence of trigger frames that schedule resources for that flow , as inputs to the AP’s uplink \\nscheduler.

However, if the IP classifier of the flow has changed, the SCS rule should instead be removed and a \\nnew SCS rule added containing the new TCLAS classifier.  \\nFor uplink SCS rules, the “change” request type can be used to change the UP/TID and/or any QoS Characteristics \\nof the flow.  \\nSCSID \\nThe SCSID field indicates an index value, selected determined by the client device, that is a unique identifier of \\nthe SCS rule between the AP and the client device.  \\nTCLAS element(s) (and TCLAS Processing element) \\nThe TCLAS element(s) indicate the IP classifier of a downlink SCS rule, as chosen by the client device . \\nA client device specifies an IP 5-tuple (or partial IP tuple) classifier by including one TCLAS element with Frame \\nClassifier Type of 4 (IP and higher layer parameters). Note that unlike the TCLAS Mask element used in MSCS, \\nthis TCLAS element explicitly specifies the IP version (IPv4 or IPv6) and the tuple field values that the classifier \\nmatches. \\nA client device can optionally specify a classifier comprised of both an IP tuple and an IPsec Security \\nParameter Index (SPI) value, by  also including a second TCLAS element with Frame Classifier Type of 10 (IP \\nextensions and higher layer parameters) and Protocol Instance of 0, together with a TCLAS Processing \\nelement with Processing value of 0 (match all).

If the request contained a QoS Characteristics element, the rejection \\nmight indicate alternat ive parameters for this element that might be accepted by the AP.  \\nSCS termination procedures and roaming \\nAn AP or client device can terminate an active SCS rule at any time. An AP terminates an SCS rule with a client \\ndevice by sending an unsolicited SCS Response frame to that client device, including an SCS Status duple \\ncontaining the SCSID of that rule and a status code value that might indicate the reason for the termination. \\nExamples of termination reasons include exhausted processing resources, insufficient network capacity to \\nsupport the QoS rule, or a conflict with network policies (which, presumably, di d not conflict at the time the SCS \\nrule was originally accepted by the AP). A client device terminates an SCS rule by sending an SCS Request frame \\nwith an SCS Descriptor element containing the SCSID of that rule with request type set to “remove”.  \\nSimilar to MSCS, a ny active SCS rules between an AP and client device are implicitly terminated at such time that \\nthe client device is no longer associated with the AP, or reassociates with the same AP . While some network \\nimplementations might derive network-wide QoS policies based on SCS rules , in general it should not be \\nexpected that SCS rules or states propagate beyond a single BSS  (or, for a Wi-Fi 7 case, a single AP MLD) . If a \\nclient device has activated one or more SCS rules with an AP and then roams to another BSS in the network \\nwhere it wishes to continue to use those SCS rules, in general the client device needs to request activation of the \\nSCS rules with the new AP in  the target BSS immediately after the roam (re)association. This applies regardless of \\nwhether the target BSS is operated by the same physical AP , except for a Wi-Fi 7 case where SCS applies to all \\nlinks of an ML association.  \\nSCS rule execution \\nIf a downlink SCS rule is activated at an  AP for a given client device, the AP attempts to classify the downlink IP \\npackets destined for that client device by matching against the classifier of that rule. An example of a downlink SCS \\nrule that causes downlink IPsec packets from a server with IP v6 address of WAN_IPADDR to a client device with IP v6 \\naddress of STA_IPADDR using ESP protocol with SPI value of 0x1234 to be assigned to UP 5 is shown below.  \\n{IPver=6; SrcIPAddr=WAN_IPADDR; DstIPAddr=STA_IPADDR; SrcPort=WAN_PORT; ProtNxtHdr= 50; \\nFilterMask=0xFFFFFFFF; FilterValue= 0x12345678} ➔ UP=5 \\nIf a QoS Characteristics element is included in a downlink SCS rule, the AP is expected to schedule the classified IP \\npackets such that the delay bound and minimum data rate parameters are met.  \\nIf a downlink IP packet matches multiple SCS rules, the rule with the most granular classifier is used  (see IEEE \\n802.11-2020 for details) . If both MSCS and SCS are simultaneously activated, the AP first attempts to match a \\ndownlink IP packet to the SCS rules; if a matching rule does not exist, it then attempts to match the packet to the \\nrules derived from MSCS mirroring. If there is no matching SCS or MSCS rule, and no other network policy is \\nconfigured that takes precedence, then by default the packet’s UP will be assigned based on DSCP mapping.  \\nIf an uplink SCS rule is activate d at an AP for a given client device, the AP is expected to schedule trigger frames with \\nRU allocation for the client device and the corresponding Preferred AC such that the delay bound, minimum data \\nrate, and minimum/maximum service interval parameters in the QoS Characteristics element are met.  \\nApplicability of SCS \\nSince an SCS request explicitly specifies the classifier for a rule, it does not (unlike MSCS) require a corresponding \\nuplink IP flow with symmetric IP addresses and ports to exist, and it allows a different UP to be assigned to the \\ndownlink flow compared to the uplink flow (if it exists).  \\nWith SCS the client device needs to explicitly request a rule for each downlink IP flow individually . The complexity \\nand overhead of SCS signaling can be high if a large number of flows need to be managed simultaneously and/or \\nthe IP flows are short -lived. In some use cases, partial IP tuple classifiers can help reduce the amount of signaling, \\ne.g., by omitting (wildcard) Destination Port in the TCLAS element classifier if the application creates many short-\\nlived connections from the same remote IP address and port to different local ports, all of which require the same \\nQoS treatment.

For example, as shown in Figure 5, the client device might send an SCS request to its AP at the time the \\nchild SAs are initiated and the corresponding SPI values, and the 5G QoS Identifiers (5QIs) of the QoS flows \\nassociated with each child SA (which can be mapped to a UP for each child SA), are known by the client device. \\nDSCP mapping \\nIn managed enterprise and carrier Wi -Fi networks, it is common for the network manager to configure certain \\nDSCP marking policies as part of network  wide QoS management. Downlink traffic might be DSCP marked at \\nsource for servers managed by the enterprise or carrier . Alternatively, downlink traffic might be DSCP marked at \\ningress to the network based on classification rules for traffic originating from third party servers on the public \\ninternet. In some cases, the network manager can also manage the DSCP marking of uplink traffic at source \\nusing Group Policy Objects (GPO) or Mobile Device Management (MDM) tools deployed on managed client \\ndevices. As discussed in the context of MSCS, some mobile app lications apply specific DSCP marking to QoS \\nsensitive uplink flows by default, even in the absence of GPO or MDM policies.  \\nIn these situations, the network manager typically wants to manage the mapping between DSCP values and UPs \\non both APs and client devices to achieve differentiated QoS for flows with prioritized DSCP marking even under \\nvarying network load. Wi -Fi QoS Management certified APs and client devices are required to support the default \\nDSCP-to-UP Mapping table defined in IETF RFC 8325, and also to support the QoS Map feature defined in IEEE \\n802.11 to indicate exceptions to that default mapping. This applies to both downlink and uplink IP packets.  \\nDSCP-to-UP mapping execution \\nWhen no other UP assignment policies such as  vendor-specific classifiers, virtual local area network (VLAN) tag \\nmapping, or MSCS rules apply, an AP or client device  determines the UP by examining the DSCP value in the IP \\nheader of the packet in the following manner:  \\nWhen the QoS Map feature is not enabled, the device is required to use the mapping table  in Figure 5 \\nbased on IETF RFC 8325.

The re is an  exception: for APs it is recommended that \\nDSCP values not authorized for use over the network are mapped to UP 0.  \\nThe DSCP-to-UP Mapping table defined in RFC 8325 addresses inconsistencies in legacy mapping tables. \\nSome legacy implementations perform the mapping simply by using the three most significant bits  of the \\nDSCP value, also known  as the deprecated “preference” value,  as the UP. This results in voice flows that \\nare marked DSCP Expedited Forwarding (EF) being allocated to UP 5, the Video access category, instead of \\nUP 6 or 7, the Voice access category. Other legacy implementations use the example mapping tables \\nincluded in earlier versions of the IEEE 802.11 standard . Th is results in video flows that are marked DSCP \\nCS42 being allocated to UP 6, or the Voice access category, instead of UP 4 or 5, the Video access category. \\nThe use of the RFC 8325 mapping table by default ensures consistency between QoS treatment over Wi -Fi \\nand the networking industry consensus on QoS traffic marking.  \\n \\nFigure 6: DSCP-to-UP Mapping based on RFC 8325 \\nWhen the QoS Map feature is enabled on a Wi -Fi QoS Management AP or client device and a non-default \\nDSCP-to-UP Mapping table is configured, the device must use that table for its own transmissions, instead \\nof the IETF RFC 8325 default mapping table.

The DSCP Policy feature enables an AP to request a client device to apply DSCP \\nmarking to specific uplink traffic flows, which are identified by a classifier based on IP tuple, port range and/or \\ndestination domain name.  The DSCP Policy feature can be used in conjunction with QoS Map, where the former \\nspecifies the DSCP marking rules and the latter provides the mapping from DSCP marking to UP. \\nThe DSCP Policy feature allows finer -grained QoS management for uplink IP flows. For example, it enables \\nconfiguration of policies that cause IP flows that would otherwise be marked with the same DSCP value (e.g ., \\nDefault Forwarding) to instead be marked with different DSCP values, and therefore assigned to different UPs.

Such classifiers can be useful when DNS load balancing is used so the \\nremote host’s IP address may not be kn own by the network a -priori. \\nIf the application layer only identifies the remote host by IP address, then flows to that host will not match a DSCP \\npolicy with a domain name classifier; a DSCP policy that specifies an IP tuple based classifier must be used instead.  \\n3GPP 5G QoS to Wi-Fi QoS Mapping \\nThe QoS Management specification def ines a default mapping table between 3GPP 5G QoS parameters (5QI, \\nPriority Level, Packet Delay Budget, Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate, etc .) and Wi -Fi QoS parameters (UP, Delay Bound, \\nMinimum Data Rate, etc .). \\nThis mapping can be used by a client device to determine the parameters in an SCS request when the client device \\nis connected to a 3GPP 5G core network over Wi -Fi access. \\nIn addition, the mapping can be used by a gateway device with 3GPP backhaul when forwarding packets from the \\n3GPP network into the Wi -Fi network. \\nDeployment of QoS mechanisms  \\nThe efficient use of unlicensed spectrum used by Wi-Fi requires good faith use of mechanisms that enable \\nprioritized access to that spectrum. Therefore, it is important that all entities that leverage Wi -Fi QoS \\nManagement features do so in a reasonable and responsible manner.  \\nNetwork IT managers should implement mechanisms that assign the appropriate UP to the corresponding traffic \\nflow to facilitate maximum network efficiency . Since the highest priority access categories use smaller contention \\nwindows (CWmin, CWmax) , the probability of collision increases when the traffic volume using those access \\ncategories increases. Network efficiency can degrade substantially in such scenarios, even when the number of \\ncontending transmitters is small. In addition, since the highest priority access category is, by default, associated \\nwith a short TXOP length, use of t hat category can substantially decrease the throughput achieved in the \\npresence of contending devices since the total airtime obtained is reduced.  \\nDevelopers of applications and services that use Wi -Fi can help ensure appropriate and effective use of these \\nmechanisms by leveraging industry best practices when assigning DSCP marking to IP flows, per the service \\nclasses defined in IETF RFC 4594. Client device operating systems can help ensure that applications use \\nappropriate access categories for uplink traffic and negotiate activation of MSCS and/or SCS with the AP when \\nQoS sensitive services are active . This helps guarantee that the same access categories are used for the \\ncorresponding downlink traffic.  \\nAP implementations can help ensure suitable network policies are configured for downlink traffic and monitor \\nuse of high priority access categories. APs can then  take suitable action , such as modifying network policies, \\nMSCS activations, QoS Map tables  and DSCP policies if excessive use of those access categories is detected, \\ncausing unacceptable impact on network performance or medium access fairness.  \\nThe features defined in the  Wi-Fi QoS Management program are focused on enabling the appropriate \\nassignment of UPs and access categories to IP flows, as well as the exchange of traffic characteristics and QoS \\nKPIs to assist the AP’s scheduler and queue management,  in order to achieve prioritized, differentiated QoS. \\nOther complementary QoS treatment mechanisms such as explicit reservation of over -the-air resources, and \\ncore network traffic management such as packet shaping, might be managed by other network policies and/or \\nprotocols, including WMM -Admission Control.

The gam e leverages APIs provided by the client device’s operating system  to set the \\nUP with which uplink IP flow is sent  to its AP and toward the online servers. For example, the application could \\nset UP 6, or the Voice access category, for latency-sensitive data flow s, UP 5, or the Video access category, for a \\nreal-time video streaming flow, and UP 0, or the Best Effort access category, for a non -real-time media assets \\nflow, such as game updates that run in the background while the user plays the game .  \\nThe applications on the client device achieve prioritized QoS treatment for uplink IP flows based on the device’s \\nrules. The rules may be strictly local  to the device or apply industry general best practices , such as  RFC 4594. For \\nexample, the latency -sensitive data flow s may match the definition of RFC 4594 Telephony class , which applies to \\njitter sensitive traffic with small, fixed size packets emitted at a constant rate. \\nIn this example, the DSCP markings of all the \\ncorresponding downlink IP flows that arrive at the AP \\nfrom the internet are equal to 0 , the QoS behavior \\nDefault Forwarding. If the AP were to assign the UP of \\neach flow based on the DSCP marking, then all the \\nflows would be sent in  the Best Effort access \\ncategory. As a result, particularly when the channel is \\nloaded, the game metadata and real -time video \\nsessions might not achieve their latency, jitter, and \\nthroughput requirements. However, since the client \\ndevice activated MSCS, the AP sets the UPs of the \\ndownlink flows based on the UPs of the \\ncorresponding uplink flows . These are determined by \\nthe client device app lication instead of the downlink \\nDSCP marking. Therefore, the user experience of the \\ngame is consistently high.  \\nThe Wi-Fi QoS Management program enables the client gaming application to influence the prioritization of IP \\ndata flows to maximize performance in that application. As a result, the game meets the requirements for low \\nlatency, low or no jitter, and high th roughput, giving the user a consistently good playing experience.  \\nEnterprise videoconferencing and remote training  \\nEnterprises deploy various network services, including videoconferencing for mission  critical communications \\nand collaboration, and video streaming service s for employee training. In environments with frequent \\nvideoconferencing and remote training , network administrators are tasked with ensuring high quality service  in \\nthose applications. To do so, the network administrator may typically configure DSCP marking on the network \\nand, where possible, on managed client devices so that videoconferencing flows are marked with the Assured \\nForwarding (AF) behavior class AF41 and EF, for Video and Voice, respectively, while the video streaming flows are \\nmarked AF31.3 Default DSCP-to-UP Mapping ensures that the AP and client devices send the video flows in the \\nVideo access category, and the voice flows in  the Voice access category. During a busy hour of peak network \\nactivity, the network is close to capacity and the videoconferencing service quality is at risk of degrading. \\nAdministrators trigger a network policy which configures the APs and client devices with a QoS Map , which maps \\nthe DSCP AF31 video streaming flow  to UP 0, the Best Effort access category, instead of UP 4, the Video access \\ncategory. This reduces the priority of the video streaming service with minimal impact on th at service, to \\n \\n3 AF41 and AF31 are values as defined in RFC 4594 . \\nFigure 7: QoS in mobile gaming  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_QoS_Management_Technology_Overview_202401.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance.

Downlink and uplink data flows with different QoS profiles are assigned to \\ndifferent IPsec child SAs between the Wi-Fi client device and the core network. Since the client device is aware of \\nthese mappings, SCS provides a convenient method for the client device to request the AP to apply appropriate \\nQoS treatment for each downlink child SA, based on its unique index (SPI).  For uplink child SAs, the client device \\ncan assign the appropriate QoS treatment for each child SA autonomously, e.g ., using DSCP marking. As a result, \\nQoS sensitive traffic such as gaming, voice and video will be prioritized bidirectionally over other bulk data traffic.  \\nAR service in a sports stadium \\nWhen a service with demanding QoS requirements such as AR -enhanced gameplay is deployed in a sports \\nstadium, the throughput and delay KPIs must be met in the presence of heavy traffic load from other \\napplications such as social network live streaming and w eb. The DSCP Policy feature provides a way for the \\nstadium’s network to dynamically request the client devices to apply specific DSCP marking to different uplink \\ntraffic flows including the AR flows . In conjunction with the QoS Map feature, this  allows the network to control \\nrelative prioritization of the traffic flows in the network to ensure the KPIs of the AR service are met.  \\nVR gaming \\nA user wears a VR headset (and possibly also sensor -equipped gloves or hand controllers) to play a multiplayer \\nVR game at home. Other uses in the same home, and in adjacent houses, are streaming video and surfing the \\nweb. The VR headset provides an immersive, first -person perspective of in -game action. Multiple QoS -sensitive \\nflows are generated between the VR headset and a cloud server, and possibly also between the VR headset and a \\nVR rendering device on the local network or the cloud. These real-time flows include bidirectional multi-channel \\nHD audio, haptic data, pose and controller data, and possibly very high resolution and high frame rate video. If \\nthe QoS requirements for these flows (such as strict latency bounds) are not met, it can lead to a poor user \\nexperience and potentially contribute to so-called “VR sickness”. \\nThe VR headset (as the client device) sends SCS requests to its AP, including QoS Characteristics, which indicate \\nthe QoS requirements for each individual flow. For example, one of the SCS descriptors describes a downlink \\nreal-time audio flow, indicating its TCLAS classifier, requesting UP 6 (voice), and indicating the flow data rate is 2 \\nMbps and the latency bound is 15 ms at the 99 th percentile. Another of the SCS descriptors describes an uplink \\npose and controller data flow, indicating it will use UP 6 (voice), that the flow rate is 2 Mbps, the latency bound is \\n2 ms at the 90th percentile, and the service interval ranges between 2 ms and 20 ms.  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_QoS_Management_Technology_Overview_202401.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance.

This trend will continue as video \\ntraffic growth increases. To deliver good quality of experience in these applications it is essential that  Wi-Fi networks \\nsupport a range of service categories that differentiate and prioritize data flows for such applications. Wi-Fi \\nnetworks that give equal priority access to all connected devices  and data flows cannot provide the throughput and \\nstability required when traffic demands exceed the available bandwidth . This negatively impacts the user \\nexperience. Access to additional spectrum and newer Wi -Fi generations, such as Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7, provide \\ncapabilities to better handle traffic with very low  latency requirements, and Wi-Fi QoS management further \\nimproves the user experience by ensuring  the interactions among the participants  of real-time applications , such as \\nvoice-over-Wi-Fi videoconferencing, AR/VR,  telemedicine, and interactive gaming, are timely and avoid skipping \\naudio or stalled video. \\nThe features of the Wi -Fi QoS Management certification program provide simple, flexible standardized \\nmechanisms to enable robust delivery of an expanding range of services with low latency requirements. The \\nprogram helps devices  leverage knowledge of application-specific QoS requirements both on client s and on the \\nnetwork. With appropriate use , these features provide strong benefits across a wide range of Wi -Fi deployments, \\nincluding residential, enterprise , and public networks. \\nAbout Wi-Fi Alliance ®   \\nwww.wi-fi.org  \\nWi-Fi Alliance® is the worldwide network of companies that brings you Wi -Fi®.

The increasing reliance on  connected devices is convincing \\nservice providers of the need to enhance the quality of service of Wi -Fi networks and deploy the latest generation of \\nWi-Fi 7 to increase capacity and reduce latency . Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Data Elements ™ is a Wi-Fi Alliance® certification that \\nprovides standardized key performance indicators  (KPIs) for Wi-Fi networks and has been augmented with the latest \\nWi-Fi 7 metrics to enable service providers to proactively improve network efficiency and latency. Service providers \\nimplementing Wi -Fi Data Elements™ devices can use the information gathered to improve technical support, offer \\ndifferentiated service, and increase customer satisfaction.  \\nTo appropriately support the wide variety of devices in the home as well as consumer applications such as video \\nstreaming and gaming, service providers need better visibility into customer Wi -Fi networks. Wi -Fi Data Elements \\nestablishes a standardized data  model built specifically for Wi -Fi networks that encompasses  hundreds of  KPIs that \\ndescribe capability, diagnostic, and optimization information , such as PHY rates, airtime utilization, and retry rates  \\nfor Wi-Fi 7 and operation of Wi-Fi CERTIFIED QoS Management™. This information provides visibility to customers’ \\nWi-Fi networks, enabling support departments  and analytic engines to quickly obtain, analyze, and respond to these \\ndynamic Wi-Fi environments.  \\nStandardizing the data model that captures Wi-Fi network conditions benefits network operators through better \\nnetwork visibility of existing deployments and opportunities for managed Wi--Fi offerings. With the partnership of \\nBroadband Forum  including Wi-Fi Data Elements in TR -181, an even larger group of diverse companies is exposed \\nto the common platform of Wi -Fi visibility. Diagnostic and analytics tool vendors also benefit by gaining the ability to \\ndevelop tools to a concise, standardized data model, eliminating the need for proprietary solutions  and reducing \\nbarriers to entry . \\nWi-Fi Data Elements is complementary to  intelligent multiple access point  (AP) networks such as Wi-Fi CERTIFIED \\nEasyMesh®. Maintaining good performance in multi-node Wi-Fi networks will improve the user experience, resulting \\nin customer loyalty and opportunities for additional equipment purchases.   \\nThis document provides an overview of the Wi -Fi Data Elements program. Further details, including specifics about \\nthe data model and each of the parameters, may be found i n the Wi-Fi Data Elements Specification . \\nKey uses for Wi-Fi Data Elements  \\nWi-Fi Data Elements provides information on the most important aspects impacting Wi-Fi network performance. \\nThis information may be leveraged by  diagnostics and analysis tools to help operators maintain optimum Wi -Fi \\nperformance and reduce the time required to diagnose network issues.  In many cases, issues can be resolved \\nbefore the customer is even aware of a problem or by the user themselves.  \\nObservability on deployment of new features  \\nMany operators are now starting to deploy the latest generation of Wi -Fi 7 to their customers. With the concurrent \\navailability of the industry standard data model supporting Wi -Fi 7, operators c an readily obtain key insight s on how \\nthe new equipment/technology is benefiting customers. Similarly, as operators enable the negotiation of Wi -Fi QoS \\nManagement™ features, operators can readily observe how station (STA) behavior improves . Wi-Fi Data Elements \\nprovides visibility whether there is a single AP or a mesh in the home. \\nSelf-help diagnostic application  \\nOperators may develop and deploy a diagnostic application based on Wi -Fi Data Elements, which users can leverage \\nto make network changes and diagnose if these changes resolve an observed issue. In cases where this diagnostic \\n \\n1 ABI Research, 2019 \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_Data_Elements_Technology_Overview_202401.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance.

Common issues include  interference from other sources \\nwithin the network, coverage or configuration challenges, and STA capabilities. Technical support agents can quickly \\nidentify the issue based upon the information from the network and can recommend a specific course of action, \\nsuch as channel or band change.  \\nResolving coverage and hardware issues  \\nIn some environments, a Wi-Fi network may be expected to cover more space than it is designed to, particularly in \\nhome networks. When a customer calls technical support for intermittent or slow service, the support agent is able \\nto review data captured from the Wi -Fi Data Elements enabled device and  determine whether there is sufficient \\nsignal strength for the coverage area. When a support agent observes that the customer’s devices are routinely \\nconnecting at low r eceived signal strength indicator ( RSSI) values or low connection speeds  (via low Modulation \\nCoding Scheme), the agent can recommend additional Wi -Fi hardware such as a Wi-Fi EasyMesh™ device, which will \\naddress the coverage issues. This benefits the user, with an opportunity to improve their service by adding a device \\nof their choice, as well as the service provider, who has the opportunity to sell additional equipment.  \\nProactive problem solving  \\nInternet service providers (ISPs) have support systems that monitor and analyze network performance data \\ncaptured from Wi -Fi devices. Wi -Fi Data Elements standardizes access to Wi -Fi drivers, so support systems no longer \\nneed to negotiate with each system on chip (SoC) vendor to retrieve KPIs. These ISP systems can access the data \\nmodel and trigger an alert when Wi -Fi service performance is impacted. For instance, an alert could be sent to the \\ntechnical support group of the ISP if an apartment building is e xperiencing high frame retry rates. Using Wi -Fi Data \\nElements with diagnostics and support tools, the system can indicate that a wide -band interference source may \\nhave been activated, and further investigation and troubleshooting can proceed even before a customer notices an \\nissue.  \\nHow Wi-Fi Data Elements works  \\nDefinitions \\nThe key components of Wi -Fi Data Elements include the data model, collector, and agent.  \\nData model \\nThe data model outlines the names, definitions , and hierarchy for Wi -Fi diagnostics and \\nconfiguration parameters. These key metrics help assess the Wi -Fi network status and \\nconnection quality and include such items as radio and channel scan results, devices on \\nthe network, and neighbor reports.  \\nCollector \\nThe role of the Wi -Fi Data Elements collector is to retrieve the elements in the standardized \\ndata model and make it available for analysis or diagnostics. The collector receives the \\nnetwork information from a Wi -Fi Data Elements agent and sends it to the specified group, \\ntypically at the service provider. The collector is software that resides on a device in the \\noperator back office management system . The collector may also act as a configuration server, sending network \\nchanges down to the agent.  \\n \\n \\nData model information \\ncan be available to the \\nuser, but more likely will be \\nsent to the service provider \\nor operator.  \\nOnce received, diagnostic \\nand analytics tools are \\napplied to determine the \\nnetwork’s health and \\nwhether action is needed  \\nto ensure good Wi -Fi \\nservice.  \\nDATA MODEL USE  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_Data_Elements_Technology_Overview_202401.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance.

The software -based agent may reside inside a  gateway, a Wi-Fi EasyMesh controller, or an \\nAP. \\nTopologies  \\nWi-Fi Data Elements can be utilized in both single AP and multiple AP networks. In single AP networks, the Wi -Fi Data \\nElements agent interacts with the Wi -Fi drivers of a standalone AP to populate the standardized data model. The  \\nWi-Fi Data Elements agent in the AP sends that information to the Wi-Fi Data Elements controller. In Wi -Fi EasyMesh \\nnetworks with multiple APs, the Wi -Fi Data Elements agent interacts with the Wi-Fi EasyMesh controller to populate \\nthe data model and then send the information to the Wi -Fi Data Elements collector.         \\n \\nProcess \\nUpon association of a device, disassociation of a device,  failed connection attempt from a device,  and at times as \\ndefined by the service provider while the network is running, the Wi -Fi Data Elements agent records the data model. \\nInformation is gathered rapidly and timestamped without use of significant network resources. The Wi-Fi Data \\nElements collector retrieves the accumulated data from the Wi-Fi Data Elements agent , which helps the provider \\nbuild a picture of the network status. The visibility gained by the provider regarding network conditions surrounding \\na reported issue enables support staff to isolate network issues more easily and suggest recommended actions to \\nthe customer.  \\nA powerful tool to improve the Wi -Fi user experience  \\nA 2019 industry study on the role of Wi -Fi in home broadband 1F\\n2 establishes that users require a good Wi -Fi \\nexperience to be satisfied with broadband service providers.

This should reduce the number of \\nsupport calls regarding Wi -Fi issues, drastically reduce the time each support agent spends on a call, and help the \\nservice provider identify opportunities sell additional equipment — all while inspiring loyalty in their customer base \\nbecause they deliver a better Wi -Fi user experience. Wi -Fi Data Elements provides the data required to provide the \\nimproved Wi-Fi user experience. \\nData model organization  \\nWi-Fi Data Elements was especially designed to organize the complexities of modern Wi -Fi networks. Previous \\nattempts at data models tended to assume a simple network structure of a single device with one radio operating \\none network, or a basic service set  (BSS). Wi-Fi Data Elements recognizes that Wi -Fi coverage is often provided by \\nmultiple devices for delivering Wi -Fi service in a single home. Each of the Wi -Fi devices likely has multiple radios — \\nat least one in the  2.4 GHz band and one or more in the 5 and 6 GHz bands. Each radio host s multiple Wi-Fi \\nnetworks (BSSs) such as the home user’s private network, the home user’s gue st network, and one or more \\noperator community networks. On each of those networks, a variety of STAs are associated or attempting to \\nassociate. Over time, STAs will roam or be steered from one radio to another radio or device. Additionally, the data \\nmodel covers the elements necessary for Multi -Link Operation, as introduced by Wi -Fi 7 (Figure 2).  \\n \\n \\nFigure 2.

Each radio \\ncan provide information and characteristics of other APs operating in the vicinity  in ScanResults. Similarly, if a STA is \\nin the vicinity, its attempts to join one of the networks are collected  in Events.

Wi-Fi 7 MLO and  Wi-Fi QoS Management from Wi-Fi Data Elements is \\ntargeted for TR-181 I ssue 2.17. \\nExamples of how Wi-Fi Data Elements data is utilized  \\nPHY rates: The pulse of the network \\nAn indicator of W i-Fi performance is the underlying physical layer \\n(PHY) rate, which is the result of all data a STA or AP uses to decide \\nhow to send a wireless frame . The most frequent causes of low \\nPHY rates are interference, low signal strength, and legacy STAs on \\nthe network. Poor PHY rates can result in poor performance for \\neverybody in the network. Wi-Fi Data Elements allows collecting the \\nPHY rates of STAs, BSSs, and radios over time. \\nFigure 5 shows the change in PHY rate as a mobile device moves \\nthroughout a home network.  When a PHY rate goes below a n \\nacceptable level, it could indicate the need for steering to another \\nradio. If low PHY rates persist over time, it may indicate the need \\nfor additional APs or for the user to update network or STAs for \\noptimum performance. \\nExample data elements utilized: \\nSTA.LastDataUplinkRate: The PHY rates most recently used for the transmission of physical layer protocol data units \\n(PPDUs) from the STA to the AP \\nSTA.LastDataDownlinkRate: The PHY rates most recently used for the transmission of PPDUs from the AP to the STA  \\nLow free airtime: Slow Wi-Fi \\nFree airtime provides one view of the health of the Wi -Fi network . Sufficient free airtime is needed for all devices to \\nbe able to perform as expected. Low free airtime is an indication that the channel utilization is getting saturated, \\nwhich will limit throughput and the number of additional STAs able to associate to the network .  \\nFigure 6 shows spikes in interference that likely cause network performance issues. The Wi -Fi Data Elements model \\ncaptures network conditions so that the service provider analytics tools can identify these spikes. Some service \\nproviders may have an alert set up once free airtime is below a certain threshold. This enables the support team to \\nproactively become aware of a potential issue and \\nbegin problem solving before a customer calls in. \\nBeyond interference, larger time periods showing a \\nlack of free airtime could point to a change in the \\nnetwork such as significant amounts of STAs \\nassociating and stressing resources, excessive data \\ntraffic, older devices that may be using too much \\nairtime, or poor coverage which may be solved with \\nadditional customer premises equipment  (CPE) \\npurchases. A service provider could choose to guide \\nthe AP to change channel or investigate further to \\nidentify other potential sources of interference.  \\nExample data elements utilized: \\nRadio.Utilization: The current total channel \\nutilization on the current primary channel  \\nRadio.Transmit: The  percentage of time the radio has spent on  individual or group addressed transmissions by the \\nAP  \\nFigure 5.

Since Wi -Fi is the primary connectivity \\ntechnology in the home, consumers demand better Wi -Fi service. Wi-Fi networks have gained complexity due to the \\nnumber and types of devices connected: video requires more bandwidth, gaming requires lower latency, and users \\nrequire good connection across the entire network. In the past, operator responsibility for the Internet connection \\nended at the wired router/gateway. Now, providers approach Wi -Fi in a more holistic fashion by including Wi -Fi \\nrouters in their consumer premise equipment options.  \\nFor service providers to offer the Wi -Fi experience users expect, it is critical that they obtain more visibility into Wi -Fi \\nnetwork behavior. Wi -Fi Data Elements devices provide this visibility which helps service providers efficiently \\nmanage and maintain Wi-Fi network performance, even as device types and numbers increase. Through a \\nstandardized Wi-Fi data model providing KPIs and remote configuration capabilities  that assist operators and \\nsupport teams in proactively troubleshooting Wi -Fi issues, Wi-Fi Data Elements is key to optimizing Wi -Fi networks to \\nprovide better user experiences and drive customer loyalty.  \\nAbout Wi-Fi Alliance® \\nwww.wi-fi.org  \\nWi-Fi Alliance® is the worldwide network of companies that brings you Wi -Fi®.

XR technologies enable immersive applications including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), \\nand mixed reality (MR), and are used to enhance or simulate real-life experiences, extending the reality we perceive \\nby either merging the virtual and real worlds or by creating fully immersive experiences. \\nWi-Fi® supplies the reliable connectivity required to deliver the full potential of XR applications and use cases. \\nPremium XR experiences require high-performance Wi-Fi for four key reasons:  \\n• Low latency for responsive and lag-free experiences \\n• High reliability with advanced features and optimization for sustained XR-class performance  \\n• Power efficiency to assist rapid and efficient data transfers with advanced power save features  \\n• Multi-gigabit speeds to deliver the instantaneous, massive data exchange XR applications demand \\nXR Market Segment Overview  \\nThe global XR market is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, and the expected total available market \\n(TAM) for all XR system markets is projected to rise over 250 billion U.S. dollars by 20281. The XR market can be \\ndivided into the following market segments of purchasers or key influencers:  \\n• Consumer: for residential use cases including multi-user VR gaming \\n• Enterprise: for use in offices, healthcare environments, etc. \\n• Industrial: technologies that support commercial and military use cases \\nWithin each market segment, XR technologies are redefining the way humans interact with each other and their \\nenvironments, enabling powerful experiences and use cases and opening new, expansive markets. Wi-Fi is the \\npreferred method of connectivity in these markets and is ideally suited to enable wireless XR systems for \\nimmersive, untethered experiences for end users across a variety of use cases.  \\nXR Use Cases \\nVR gaming \\nVirtual Reality (VR) gaming is the new generation of computer games \\nthat utilize XR technology to give players a truly immersive, first-person \\nperspective of in-game action. Participants both experience and \\ninfluence the gaming environment through a variety of VR gaming \\ndevices and accessories including Head Mounted Displays (HMDs), \\nsensor-equipped gloves, and hand controllers. VR games can be played \\nstandalone, online multiplayer, or massive multiplayer (i.e., online \\ncommunity) using specialized game consoles or advanced PCs serving \\nas companion compute devices. \\nDevices and topologies in typical VR gaming setups \\nA typical high-end VR gaming setup encompasses some or all of the following devices:  \\n● VR HMD, controllers, and sensing accessories \\n● Access Point (AP)  \\n● PC or game consoles  \\n \\nIn the simplest setup, the HMD connects to controllers and other accessories, with all computing local to the HMD. \\nThe HMD may also connect to a remote server via the AP to offload some or all of its compute. This offloading case \\nrequires high throughput and low latency on the wireless link to deliver an immersive experience. Finally, remote \\ncomputing and graphics rendering may happen on a local PC (or a laptop, gaming console, etc.) that serves as a \\n \\n1 Statista, July 2022 \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi brings immersive XR experiences to life.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance.

In this scenario, the compute device services the compute-intensive workloads for VR \\ngaming, including graphics rendering and video compression. The rendered data is then transmitted to the HMD \\nover Wi-Fi. The PC and HMD may connect via an infrastructure network provisioned by an AP, or they may connect \\ndirectly via a peer-to-peer (P2P) link. In the opposite direction, pose (Inertial Measurement Unit [IMU], button press, \\netc.) data is sent from the HMD to the PC. In addition, there could also be best-effort traffic being exchanged with a \\ngaming server on the cloud, such as in multiplayer games. This use case may encompass multiple wireless \\ntechnologies and has stringent throughput and latency requirements. \\nFunctional requirements for a high-end VR gaming experience \\nFor VR gaming use cases, stringent low latency and high throughput requirements must be met to ensure a \\nsmooth user experience. If the requirements are not satisfied, users may experience significant lags and in the \\nworst case, even VR-induced dizziness or nausea. \\nRequirements for video frames \\nVideo frames may be rendered by the gaming engine on the PC, encoded by the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), \\nand transmitted from the PC to the HMD through an AP at fixed intervals of time, governed by the refresh rate of \\nthe game (currently up to 120 Hz). Video frames are expected to be displayed at a given future (VSync) time on the \\nHMD. Therefore, these video frames must be transmitted over the Wi-Fi link with high likelihood as a function of the \\nlatency distribution, as shown in the table below. Note that these latency numbers account only for the actual \\ntransmission time of the video frame from PC to HMD over an AP, and do not include operations such as rendering and \\nencoding/decoding of the frames. \\nRequirements for other traffic streams \\nVR gaming may also contain additional traffic streams transmitted from the PC to the HMD and vice versa with \\nrequirements captured in the table below. Pose/IMU traffic contains information on controller and HMD \\nmovements by the user, which must be precisely tracked at a rate of 500 Hz. Pose/IMU traffic has the most \\nstringent latency requirements of all other streams.  \\nTraffic Stream KPI Description Specification \\nVideo frames (PC to HMD) Bit Rate (Throughput) 100 Mbps to 200 Mbps (4k/8k @ 72-120 Hz) \\nLatency  P75 < 5 ms, P95 <10 ms, P99.9 < 50 ms \\nPose/IMU/Controller button presses \\n(HMD to PC) \\nThroughput 2 Mbps \\nLatency P90 < 2 ms; P99.9 < 10 ms \\nMIC Audio (HMD to PC) Throughput < 1 Mbps \\nLatency P90 < 10 ms; P99.9 < 15 ms \\nHaptics (PC to HMD) Latency P90 < 10 ms; P99.9 < 15 ms \\nAudio (PC to MHD) Throughput 2 Mbps \\nLatency P90 < 10 ms; P99.9 < 15 ms \\n \\nEnterprise collaboration and enhancing workplace productivity \\nEnterprise immersion is a form of hybrid work enabled by existing and next-generation XR applications that give a \\ntruly immersive work experience to employees, customers, and IT end users. Whether it is groups of students \\nlearning with the help of VR, product designers creating collaboratively in a mix of real and virtual space (MR), or \\nenhancing hybrid workers’ productivity in their virtualized workspaces, XR systems must deliver sensory '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi brings immersive XR experiences to life.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance.

Each of these \\nexperiences can be individual (interacting with the system) or multi-\\nuser (interacting with others) with both real and synthetic (e.g., AI) \\nparticipants. \\nThese immersive experiences require not only Enterprise-grade XR \\ndevices such as comfortable low-weight HMDs, but also high-speed \\nand deterministic network connectivity to access compute resources. \\nWi-Fi, and in particular, Wi-Fi CERTIFIED® programs such as Wi-Fi 6E \\nand Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 7™ are ideally suited for delivering the full \\npotential of the immersive XR workspace by providing both high-\\nspeed and low latency to meet stringent XR performance requirements. \\nDevices and topologies in the immersive workspace \\nA typical Enterprise XR system encompasses all or a subset of the following devices:  \\n● XR HMD plus controllers and sensing accessories \\n● Enterprise-grade wireless LAN (WLAN)  \\n● Enterprise-cloud/edge-hosted XR applications \\n● Wired or wireless paired companion devices  \\nIn the simplest deployment, the standalone HMD (XR Device) connects to its controllers, all rendering local to the \\nHMD. In this case, the Wi-Fi link between the AP and the HMD is not considered time-critical. For more complex \\nEnterprise-grade experiences, the HMD can use split rendering and offload some or all its rendering to an \\nedge/cloud service via the WLAN making the Wi-Fi link between the AP and HMD time-critical. In other deployments, \\na user’s personal compute device or companion device is paired to the HMD for rendering offload making the peer-\\nto-peer (P2P) link between the AP and the HMD time-critical. In all cases, the HMD can simultaneously leverage a \\nnon-time-critical Wi-Fi link for non-real-time portions of app functionality (e.g., software updates). \\nIn these offload modes over time-critical XR links, video and audio frames are typically rendered and delivered to \\nthe HMD in the downlink (DL) direction over the Wi-Fi or P2P links with corresponding HMD data (pose, IMU, \\ncontroller state, mic. audio/camera, video, etc.) delivered in the uplink (UL) direction. This mutual dependency is \\noften referred to as a motion-to-photon (M-to-P) requirement which needs bounded (worst-case) latency \\ncompliance.   \\nFunctional requirements for an immersive enterprise XR experience \\nFor all XR use cases described above, both the HMD and the companion device must be securely onboarded to \\nthe WLAN before it can be served by the infrastructure. Enterprise-grade authentication (WPA3™ Enterprise) and \\ntechnologies such as Wi-Fi QoS Management™ may be needed to ensure appropriate Enterprise network QoS \\nenablement. \\nFor the rendering offload cases, stringent low latency and high throughput requirements must be met to ensure a \\nsmooth user experience. Failing to satisfy these requirements may lead to user dissatisfaction and thus lower \\ncollaboration engagement and productivity. If the M-to-P requirement (bounded latency) is not met, for example, \\nusers may experience XR-induced fatigue and dizziness. Signaling of these specific flow requirements is \\nenvisioned via Wi-Fi QoS Management and Wi-Fi 7 SCS QoS Characteristics. \\nIt is important to note that in an Enterprise environment, both time-critical Wi-Fi links (AP to HMD, Companion to \\nHMD) must be managed in a way that neither can disrupt the latency/throughput targets of the other. This is \\nespecially important when the AP is serving other time-critical flows in the presence of several individual time-\\ncritical Wi-Fi Direct/P2P links. For these cases, it is expected a form of coordination between the AP-managed Wi-Fi \\nand Wi-Fi Direct/P2P links is provided that, for example, supports contention/interference-free channels and/or \\ntime slots to the latter given knowledge of the time-critical flow requirements by the former. Specifically, Wi-Fi 7 \\nmethods such as SCS QoS Characteristics and TXOP Sharing are appropriate.   \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi brings immersive XR experiences to life.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance.

These frames are transmitted to the HMD via Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi Direct/P2P links with the expectation of a \\nspecific latency distribution, as shown in the table below. Note that these latency targets account only for the actual \\ntransmission time of the video frame over the link, and do not include operations such as rendering and \\nencoding/decoding of the frames. \\nWhile the nominal or target video inter-arrival time (period) is established by the codec and VSync requirements, the \\nactual period (as measured) varies due to compression (e.g., motion) and other factors. This means any QoS, or \\nscheduling capability must account for the non-arrival of a video frame at the nominal period. \\nTraffic Stream KPI Description Specification \\nVideo frames (to HMD) Bit Rate (Throughput) Min. 30 Mbps (1080p @ 72 Hz) \\nPeriod Nominal:13.8ms; P99 < 20 ms \\nLatency*  P75 < 10 ms, P95 <15 ms, P99 < 20 ms \\nPose/IMU/Controller button presses (HMD to PC) Throughput 2 Mbps** \\n Latency P90 < 2 ms; P99.9 < 10 ms** \\nMIC Audio (HMD to PC) Throughput < 1 Mbps** \\n Latency P90 < 10 ms; P99.9 < 15 ms** \\nHaptics (PC to HMD) Latency P90 < 10 ms; P99.9 < 15 ms** \\nAudio (PC to MHD) Throughput 2 Mbps** \\n Latency P90 < 10 ms; P99.9 < 15 ms** \\n*Latency is suggested-only and based on empirical observations (i.e., no experience impact was measured) **as per VR gaming requirements \\nSocial VR \\nSocial VR encompasses social media and connections among users in \\nVirtual Reality (VR) through shared, immersive experiences.

It involves the integration of multiple VR and MR functionalities such \\nas 6DoF streaming with VR conversational services along with capturing facial expressions, eye movement, and \\nbody gestures, and mapping to users’ digital representations in real-time. VR objects such as virtual spaces, user \\navatars, conversational media, sound sources, streaming content, social feeds, etc. originating from different \\nsources are combined into a single social VR experience. Rendering of Social VR content could be done locally on \\nthe HMD or remotely on a server (e.g., running as a cloud service).  \\nIn increasing Social VR use cases, end users are often located in different geographic regions and are able to join \\ntogether in a virtual space. Such use cases typically require only a small number of VR devices (e.g., <10 HMDs) \\nconnected over a Wi-Fi network, which is distinct from other enterprise VR collaboration use cases requiring a large \\nnumber of wirelessly connected VR devices over a narrow range of coverage. Social VR applications have strict \\nlatency requirements with low jitter to deliver premium and immersive VR experiences, and as such the Wi-Fi \\nnetwork should support high throughput and low latency. Power efficiency is another key requirement as VR \\ndevices are battery operated and low power consumption while communicating is critical to ensure long battery life. \\nThroughput and latency requirements for the Wi-Fi network for a typical Social VR use case are described in the \\ntable below: \\n \\n   Traffic Stream    KPI Description Specification \\nDownlink (AP to HMD) \\nVideo traffic for streaming, calling, etc., \\nvirtual space data, other application data \\nBit Rate (Throughput) 20-30 Mbps (video streams typically have 60Hz-\\n120 Hz frame rates) \\nLatency  P75 < 10 ms, P95 <15 ms, P99 < 50 ms \\nUplink (HMD to AP) \\nSensor data, audio \\nThroughput Up to 5 Mbps \\nLatency P90 < 10 ms; P99 < 20 ms \\n \\nWi-Fi Certified Technologies to Deliver the Ultimate XR Experience \\nWi-Fi 7 \\nWi-Fi CERTIFIED 7, based on IEEE 802.11be technology, enhances Wi-Fi performance in the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 \\nGHz bands, bringing cutting-edge capabilities to enable innovations that require high throughput, lower latency, and \\ngreater reliability across home, enterprise, and industrial environments.

Wi-Fi 7 features such as Triggered uplink access enable prioritized delivery of latency-sensitive traffic with \\npredictable latency. \\nQoS Management \\nWi-Fi QoS Management provides robust service delivery and higher-quality experiences with latency-sensitive \\napplications in Wi-Fi networks.  \\nThe program builds on the widely adopted Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) technology and helps deliver consistent, end-\\nto-end QoS treatment. It enables Wi-Fi devices, applications, and network managers to prioritize traffic flows. The \\nprogram benefits residential, enterprise, and public networks. It works with all Wi-Fi generations and includes \\ncertain features that are optimized for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7 devices. \\nWi-Fi QoS Management features focus on uplink assignment and scheduler behavior. The assignment of the User \\nPriority (UP) used by the stream in the Traffic Identifier (TID) subfield, is critical to QoS management since it \\ndetermines the WMM Access Category used for a flow’s transmission and can help reduce head-of-line queuing \\ndelays for latency-sensitive traffic. Scheduler behavior is becoming increasingly important. In the downlink, the AP’s \\nscheduler must manage multiple downlink flows and users with different traffic characteristics and KPIs. In the \\nuplink, the AP can schedule resources for STAs depending on the traffic characteristics and KPIs of uplink flows, \\nusing Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7 trigger frames. \\nWi-Fi QoS Management supports both client-centric and network-centric QoS management. The client-centric \\nfeatures are the most useful when client devices (or apps running on those devices) have the best knowledge of the \\nQoS requirements for given data flows. The network-centric features are most useful in cases where the \\nnetwork/venue needs to manage QoS at the system level, such as when mission-critical enterprise services are \\ndeployed. Client-centric and network-centric features can be used simultaneously. \\nClient-centric features \\nThe client-centric features defined in the program are MSCS (Mirrored Stream Classification Service) and SCS \\n(Stream Classification Service).  \\nIn the MSCS feature, the STA sends a request to the AP to activate QoS mirroring. Once activated, the AP derives \\ndownlink UP assignment rules by monitoring and mirroring the UP of uplink IP packets in each bidirectional IP flow. \\nEach derived MSCS rule is associated with an IP tuple-based classifier. \\nIn the SCS feature, the STA sends a request to the AP to apply a downlink UP assignment rule for a given flow, \\nassociated with an IP tuple (or IPsec header) based classifier explicitly included in the request. The SCS request can \\nalso contain explicit traffic characteristics (such as burst size and burst cadence) and key performance indicators \\n(KPIs), such as maximum latency, for each flow that the AP’s scheduler is expected to meet.

All rights reserved.  7 of 9 \\nIn addition, an STA can also send an SCS request to an AP containing traffic characteristics and KPIs for an uplink \\nflow. In this case, the AP is expected to facilitate the scheduling of the STA’s uplink transmissions using trigger \\nframes defined in Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7 to meet the KPIs. \\nNetwork-centric features \\nThe network-centric features defined in the program are QoS Map and DSCP Policy. \\nIn the QoS Map feature, the AP configures each associated STA with a (custom) DSCP-to-UP mapping table used for \\nthe STA’s uplink transmissions, either during or post-association. This is useful when the network needs to reassign \\nthe QoS priority of uplink flows that the STA marks with a given DSCP value. \\nIn the DSCP Policy feature, the AP sends a request to the STA to apply a policy for DSCP marking of a given uplink \\ntraffic flow, associated with an IP tuple or domain name-based classifier explicitly included in the request. DSCP \\nPolicy, especially when combined with QoS Map, provides finer granularity when the network needs to reassign the \\nQoS priority of individual uplink flows.  \\nIn addition, the QoS Management program defines the use (by both APs and STAs) of the DSCP-to-UP mapping table \\nin IETF 8325 by default. This mapping is used to determine the UP of flows for which other features (such as MSCS, \\nSCS, and QoS Map) do not apply. \\nSummary \\nQoS Management features currently primarily target QoS-sensitive flows traversing infrastructure networks, for \\nexample where XR devices are connected to rendering and/or compute engines located on the local network, edge, \\nor public Internet. Each XR flow – such as those corresponding to video, audio, haptic, and motion tracking – can \\nhave its QoS treatment managed based on its individual traffic characteristics and KPI requirements.  \\nWi-Fi 6 \\nWi-Fi CERTIFIED 6, the industry certification program based on the IEEE 802.11ax standard, provides the capacity, \\nefficiency, coverage, and performance required by users today in highly demanding Wi-Fi environments. \\nEmphasizing quality connectivity in locations with hundreds or thousands of connected devices such as stadiums \\nand other public venues, as well as corporate networks utilizing time-sensitive, high bandwidth applications, Wi-Fi \\nCERTIFIED 6 networks ensure each connected device performs at an optimum level.

The key innovation of Wi -Fi 7, however, is not \\nnecessarily in achieving these high data rates, rather the \\nintroduction of a multi-link operation concept into Wi-Fi. In this \\npaper we will provide a  brief overview of the key Wi-Fi 7 \\ntechnology innovations and discuss why we expect future Wi-Fi \\ntechnologies will need to expand on the multi-link concept and \\nnew spectrum to continue deliver increasing end-user value with \\nfuture Wi-Fi generations. \\nIndex Terms — 802.11be, Wi-Fi 7, Wi -Fi 8, Throughput, \\nQuality of service, Multi-link communication. \\nI. INTRODUCTION \\nWi-Fi, based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards is the \\npredominant wireless networking technology, delivering \\nmore data than any other wireless access technology, cellular \\nincluded [1]. One of the key pillars of the Wi-Fi success story \\nhas been its forward and backward compatibility – i.e., the \\nlatest Wi-Fi device is almost guaranteed to interoperate with \\ndevices designed to support older versions of the standard. \\nThis guarantee allowed organic network and device evolution \\nsince the early days of 802.11a/b/g with its 54Mbps peak data \\nrates, to upcoming Wi -Fi 7 which is positioned to deliver \\npeak data rates that are at least 100x higher (> 5 Gbps).  \\nWhile it is easy to relate to Wi-Fi evolution mostly by peak \\ndata rate, this was never really the case, and more so starting \\nWi-Fi 6, with one of the key challenges in enabling some of \\nthese other innovations in cross-generational Wi-Fi networks. \\nThe introduction of the 6 GHz band in 2021 [2] presented an \\nopportunity to break this mold , while still allowing legacy \\ndevices to operate in the 2.4 and 5  GHz bands.  Another \\nopportunity to accelerate the adoption of new Wi -Fi \\ncapabilities comes with the introduction of  multi-link \\noperation with Wi-Fi 7. \\nThe rest of this paper will review the key innovations of \\nWi-Fi 7 and some of the expected challenges in their \\nenablement. The paper starts with a brief introduction of the \\nkey features, describes the multi-link operation framework, \\nfollowed by a discussion of PHY innovations and achievable \\ndata rates  and MAC enhancements not related to multi -link \\noperation. Following this introduction, the pa per discusses \\nsome of challenges in achieving Wi-Fi 7 potential benefits \\nand concluded with a brief discussion showing why Wi -Fi 7 \\nis expected to set the stage for future Wi-Fi generations. \\nII. KEY FEATURES \\nWith draft 3.0 of the IEEE 802.11be amendment already \\navailable as of March 2023, the main standard development \\nwork is already done, and indeed some products have already \\nbeen introduced to the market at the beginning of the year  \\nahead of a Wi-Fi Alliance Certification. \\nThe limelight features of Wi-Fi 7 are: \\n• 320 MHz wide channels. \\n• 4,096 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). \\n• Multi-link operation, and related features. \\nIn addition to these, Wi-Fi 7 promises: \\n• Improved coexistence with incumbents and other \\ntechnologies using Multi-RU (MRU) allocations. \\n• Delivery of services with deterministic latency using \\nrestricted target wake time (rTWT). \\nand \\n• Improved area capacity and reduce d latency in multi -AP \\nmesh and mixed networking/peer-to-peer scenarios \\nthrough the introduction of s hared Transmission \\nopportunities (TxOPs). \\nIII. MULTI-LINK OPERATION \\nCurrent Wi-Fi connections use a single logical link over a \\nsingle radio frequency ( RF) channel per connection where \\nany change in the connection configuration between two Wi-\\nFi devices (e.g., change in the RF channel) requires a MAC \\nlevel reassociation or a roaming flow.  In general, an 802.11 \\nlink is a MAC level logical entity  between two devices  that \\noperate on a given RF channel,  or subset of the RF channel \\n(e.g., in the case that only a portion of the channel is \\navailable for use). \\nWi-Fi 7 is changing this paradigm through the introduction \\nof a multi-link operation (MLO) framework. MLO maintains \\non one hand the existing per-link connection, allowing \\ninteroperability with “legacy” pre -MLO devices, but \\nintroduces, however, a new multi-link device (MLD) logical \\nentity that manages the multiple links a device supports, and \\nexposes a single MAC data service access point (SAP) across \\nall links as shown in  Fig. 1. Note that the MLO framework \\ndoes not require a device to integrate multiple transceivers. \\nThe standard defines the  following MLD types or MLO \\nmodes of operation [3],[4]. \\n \\nFig. 1 Wi-Fi 7 multi-link framework \\n \\n2024 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas, Biomedical Engineering and Electronic Systems \\n(COMCAS)\\n979-8-3503-4818-7/24/$31.00 ©2024 IEEE\\n2024 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas, Biomedical Engineering and Electronic Systems (COMCAS) | 979-8-3503-4818-7/24/$31.00 ©2024 IEEE | DOI: 10.1109/COMCAS58210.2024.10666165\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Univ of Calif Riverside.

There are \\ntwo flavors of MLMR devices – simultaneous and non-\\nsimultaneous tra nsmit-receive (STR and NSTR) MLM R \\ndevices. STR-MLMR devices can operate their multiple links \\nasynchronously, potentially transmitting on one link while \\nreceiving on the other, while NSTR MLMR devices must \\nsynchronize the operation of their multiple links . A MLMR \\ndevice could be STR capable in some link configurations \\nwhile being constrained to NSTR mode for others. \\n4) Enhanced Multi -Link Multi -Radio (eMLMR) devices \\ncan dynamically reconfigure their multiple radios across the \\ndifferent links (e.g., support either of 2 -spatial stream \\noperation on a single link or two single spatial streams \\noperation across two different links).  Like MLMR devices, \\neMLMR devices could be constrained to operate in STR or in \\nNSTR modes. \\n \\nMLO is expected to deliver multiple benefits starting with \\nfaster connection transitions between the different links an \\naccess point (AP) supports, reduced latency  and increased \\nthroughput in congested environments, and all the way to \\ndata rate aggregation across multiple  links that are possible \\nwith STR-MLMR devices. It should be noted that the MLO \\nframework may need to be configured differently (potentially \\nper connection) to optimize for the wanted benefit. \\nImportant, if less  mentioned, aspects of the MLO \\nframework are multi-link discovery , multi-link setup, multi-\\nlink block ack and power save, as well as multi-link specific \\nQoS enhancements . A Wi -Fi 7 MLD AP is required to \\nadvertise the basic information for all its links in each of the \\nindividual AP beacons. Further, a non-AP MLD can request \\ndetailed information for all the links an AP MLD supports – \\nsignificantly reducing multi -link discovery time and \\noverheads. The multi-link setup process was defined to have \\na single association and authentication process  for all the \\nlinks an AP supports. Here, the association flow was \\nenhanced to relate to the link specific STA information and \\nthe device level MLD MAC . Further the Wi -Fi 4 -way \\nsecurity handshake was extended to relate to the multi -link \\naspects. The security handshake establishes a unified security \\ncontext across all links, sharing the pairwise master key \\n(PMK), pairwise transient key (PTK) and packet num ber \\n(PN) space across all links . At the same time, and to better \\ninteroperate with legacy devices, the MLD security \\nframework maintains per -link broadcast and multicast \\ncontext with a per -link group temporal key  (GTK), integrity \\ngroup temporal key (IGTK), and beacon integrity temporal \\nkey (BIGTK), as well as per -link broadcast and multicast PN \\nspace. \\nIV. PHY ENHANCEMENTS AND ACHIEVABLE DATA RATES \\nThe primary PHY enhancements of Wi -Fi 7 are the \\nintroduction of 320 MHz wide channels that when combined \\nwith the 4,096 QAM modulation scheme the standard \\nintroduces, increases the per-link data rate by a factor of 2.4x. \\nThis puts the peak PHY data rate of a single 2 -spatial stream \\nlink at 5.76  Gbps, and that of an 8 spatial stream (the \\nmaximum supported by the standard) link at just over 23 \\nGbps.  \\nFurther, Wi-Fi 7 MLMR devices , can deliver much higher \\naggregate data rates with a potential 8.65 Gbps peak data rate \\nbetween a 2-antenna Wi-Fi 7 station (STA) and a Wi-Fi 7 AP \\n(using one 160MHz channel in the 5GHz ban d and one \\n320MHz channel in the 6GHz band) . This is only  a shade \\nlower than the 9.6 Gbps peak achievable Wi-Fi 6 data rate \\nover an 8-spatial stream connection, as shown in Fig. 2. \\n \\nFig. 2 Wi-Fi 7 usable data rates compared to Wi-Fi 6 peak data rate. \\n \\nAnother key Wi-Fi 7 PHY enhancement is the capability of \\nan AP to allocate multiple resource uni ts (MRUs) to a single \\nstation. Through MRU, Wi -Fi 7 devices can better utilize \\nwide-band channel connections even in the presence of \\nincumbent services (in the 6 GHz band), or interference \\n(from other Wi-Fi or other transmitters) , increasing the \\noverall spectral efficiency of Wi -Fi networks, even when a \\nlimited number of STAs are connected to an AP. \\nSeveral of the PHY enhancements targeted for Wi-Fi 7 did \\nnot make it into the specification . These include an increase \\nin the maximum allowed MIMO order from 8 spatial streams \\nto 16 spatial streams [3],[4], and the intr oduction of a \\ndistributed tones OFDMA resource unit (RU).  Distributed \\ntones RU was expected to allow a STA to increase its overall \\ntransmit power, when operating under the constraints of a \\npower spectral density (PSD) limit and reduce required \\ntransmissions times at low data rates. Further, distributing the \\nused subcarriers over the complete channel bandwidth \\nprovides better link reliability over frequency selective \\nchannels due to the greater frequency diversity . Distributed \\nRU may yet be introduced in a future Wi -Fi amendment. On \\nthe other hand, there are limited expectations to see a future \\nincrease in the maximum spatial stream order to 16, given the \\nrelated cost and complexities  that make even 8 -spatial \\nstreams APs rare products.  \\n \\n \\n2024 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas, Biomedical Engineering and Electronic Systems \\n(COMCAS)\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Univ of Calif Riverside.

BEYOND MULTI-LINK \\nIn addition to the introduction of the MLO framework  and \\nhigher data rates , Wi -Fi 7 extends the Wi-Fi quality of \\nservice (QoS) framework to further reduce data delivery \\nlatency and jitter  through the introduction of a new QoS \\nprovisioning scheme and channel access management \\nmechanisms.  \\nTo help AP scheduler s, Wi -Fi 7 implements and extends \\nthe stream classification service (SCS) protocol . SCS allows \\nnon-AP STAs to provide the AP with IP traffic classifications \\nrules using the traffic classification ( TCLAS) element to \\nassign per-application user priorit ies (and related access \\ncategories) [5]. In addition, Wi-Fi 7 SCS allows a STA to add \\na comprehensive description of the service requirements, \\nincluding service interval and data rate information. This \\nextra information , in conjunction with the existing traffic \\nspecification (TSPEC) element, provides the necessary \\ninformation for AP schedulers to efficiently schedule trigger-\\nbased uplink (UL) traffic and prioritize downlink (DL) traffic  \\nto the different STAs it serves. \\nIn addition to extending the SCS framework, Wi-Fi 7 \\nintroduces several features targeted to reduce jitter and \\nenhance reliability . One such key feature is restricted target \\nwake time (rTWT) that complements the existing target wake \\ntime (TWT) mechanism . Whereas TWT can be used to \\nmanage STA power save and availability as well as to group \\nSTAs into availability groups, to help with multi-user \\nscheduling, with rTWT, the AP can reserve service periods \\n(SP) for STAs and  applications that require the increased \\nreliability and reduced jitter.  To guarantee the reservation, \\nany Wi-Fi 7 non -AP STA that supports rTWT is required to \\nend any transmissions before the rTWT SP starts, and the AP \\ncan further protect the rTWT SP with a quite time interval \\nwhich prohibits STAs that are not members of the rTWT SP \\nfrom accessing the channe l. rTWT is especially useful in \\nmanaged environments (e.g., factory floors)  where it can be \\nensured that all STAs in the area support the feature, and \\nthrough that almost eliminate latency and jitter. \\nAnother QoS enhancing feature is traffic identifier (TID) to \\nlink mapping (T2LM). Through T2LM, the AP can define on \\nwhich links specific QoS classes (access categories)  can be \\ntransmitted on . Through T2LM a Wi -Fi 7 AP can, e.g., \\ndedicate its 6 GHz link  to latency sensitive traffic, and \\nthrough that further help reduce its jitter.  When used in \\nconjunction with  link steering and the other QoS enhancing \\nWi-Fi 7 features , a Wi -Fi 7 AP can effectively manage the \\nlatency and jitter of services across its network. \\nVI. TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES  \\nThere are several ch allenges related to the development \\nand deployment of new technologies, and Wi-Fi 7 is no \\nexception. Further, due to the Wi -Fi promise of backward \\nand forward compatibility , Wi-Fi 7 technology and products \\nface some unique related challenges . At least some of these, \\nas we will show, are due to implementation in older devices  \\nthat did not relate to the forward compatibility promise. \\nA. PHY Challenges \\nThe introduction of 320 MHz wide channels, and 4,096 \\nQAM (also known as 4K -QAM), brings with i t a set of \\nimplementation challenges that may make it difficult for Wi -\\nFi technology to evolve to allow higher data rates in future \\ngenerations. \\nThe signal to noise (SNR) requirement of supporting  a \\n4,096 QAM with a 5/6 rate are such, that the standard \\nmandates meeting a modulation accuracy of -38 dB relative \\nconstellation error (or error vector magnitude (EVM)) for \\nthis modulation scheme. This, of course, directly impacts  \\nthe implementation complexity of the transmitter and \\nreceiver. Comparing this requirement, to the -35 dB EVM \\nrequirement for the  5/6 encoded 1,024 QAM scheme \\nintroduced with Wi -Fi 6, we can see this is already a \\ncompromise, given the straightforward information \\ntheoretical requirement is 5 dB more stringent.  As a result, \\nthe re ceiver implementation complexity of Wi -Fi 7 is \\nexpected to be higher than that of previous Wi-Fi receivers. \\nWhen considering the link -budget for 320 MHz wide \\nchannels, and the regulatory limits on Tx power Wi -Fi \\noperates under, we can see that the effective distance for \\ndelivering the maximum throughputs with Wi-Fi 7 is \\nexpected to be limited. This also limits the potential for \\nfuture data rate growth in the current frequency bands. \\n• Maximum allowed Tx power (6 GHz band, Standard \\npower AP [6]): 36 dBmi \\n• Thermal noise floor at 320 MHz: -88.9 dBm \\n• SNR required at the receiver input to  achieve 1  dB \\ndegradation (vs -38 dB required transmitter EVM) : \\n43.9 dB. \\n• Required signal strength at receiver input: -45 dBm. \\n \\nFig. 3 Wi-Fi 7 4K-QAM Outage Performance over IEEE B \\nand D channel models \\n \\nAs the received signal strength for real -world Wi -Fi \\ndevices is typically lower than -50 dBm (which indeed is \\nassigned a receive signal strength indication (RSSI) of 100% \\nin some implemen tations). It should be noted that the IEEE \\n802.11be reference channel model [7], with an Outage \\nperformance demonstrated over both the IEEE indoor \\nresidential and office environment channel models (IEEE \\n802.11 channel B and D respectively), allows for a \\n2024 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas, Biomedical Engineering and Electronic Systems \\n(COMCAS)\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Univ of Calif Riverside.

If we \\ndo take the -50 dBm RSSI value as a target,  it is easy to see \\nthat regardless of channel availability, the potential to benefit \\nfrom increasing channel bandwidth or modulation scheme is \\ngoing to be limited, given the existing regulatory constraints.  \\nB. Deployment Challenges \\nAs described in section  III above, Wi -Fi 7 MLO uses the \\nsame security credentials for all the links. This effectively \\nmandates using the same security scheme across all links. \\nWith many Wi-Fi 7 APs expected to support operation in the \\n6 GHz band and Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 ( WPA3) \\nmandated in the band, Wi -Fi 7 essentially mandates  use of \\nWPA3. On one hand, moving the network security baseline \\nto WPA3 is a good thing, on the other hand, there is the \\nWi-Fi promise of maintaining backward compatibility, and \\nspecifically ensuring older devices  that may not support the \\nlatest Wi -Fi tec hnologies (including WPA3), could still \\nconnect to Wi -Fi 7 networks. While the Wi -Fi standard has \\naddressed this concern introducing the WPA3 transition \\nmode [8], there are multiple devices (e.g., Internet of things \\n(IOT) devices, and even older Smartphones) that can only \\nconnect to WPA2 networks and would not connect to \\nnetworks configured for WPA3 transition mode. As a result, \\nmany internet service providers (ISPs ) and AP vendors \\nconfigure their APs today to WPA2, regardless of the \\navailability of updated Wi -Fi security standards. This creates \\ntwo contradicting requirements: \\n1) Use a single WPA3 security scheme across all bands of \\noperations. \\n2) Use only WPA2 network security in 2.4, 5GHz bands. \\n \\nA related complication is that Wi -Fi 7 adds support for a \\nWPA3-Personal flavor using GCMP256 encryption.  \\nTherefore, for a Wi -Fi 7 AP to support both Wi -Fi 7 and \\nolder STAs supporting WPA3 , it needs to support multiple \\nauthentication and key management (AKM) suites within \\nWPA3. This is like the WPA3 transition mode scheme that \\nwas designed to address a similar issue (where one AKM was \\nthe WPA2 AKM, and another the WPA3 AKM) . As the main \\nissue with STAs that were not desig ned with forward \\ncompatibility in mind is that they do not connect to a network \\nsupporting multiple AKMs , a potential solution could be to \\nconfigure Wi -Fi 7 APs to have two different networks \\n(service set identifiers, or SSIDs), one “legacy” SSID \\nconfigured in WPA2 only mode in the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, \\nto support legacy devices, and a second, WPA3 SSID  \\nconfigured with multiple AKMs to support newer, standard \\ncompliant STAs. \\nThis proposed scheme creates further potential \\ncomplexities. The first is the need to configure two different \\nnetworks, each with its own SSID. The second would be to \\ndesign APs to allow devices on one network/SSID to \\ndiscover and access devices on the other network/SSID, \\ncreating a unified network. Further, users will need to be \\neducated that the two different networks form a single \\nnetwork. When considering that in many deployments there \\nare also Guest networks, and that there are cases where there \\nis interest to create further isolated networks (e.g., fo r utility \\ncompanies, etc.), this may require each AP to be configured \\nwith a multiplicity of SSIDs and virtual networks. \\nThis discussion specifically relates to “personal” (home , or \\nsmall venue) networks, as in most IT deployed networks, and \\nregardless of WPA3 transition mode applicability to  \\nnetworks using WPA3 -Enterprise, in many cases IT \\nmanagers already deploy dedicated network per Wi -Fi \\nsecurity protocol version  and configur e IT peripherals with \\nthe right credentials to access the network / SSID that best \\nfits the device capabilities and usages. \\nAn unrelated challenge , which is relevant for both \\n“personal,” and “enterprise” Wi -Fi 7 APs , that will need to \\nbe addressed by AP ven dors is the network MLO \\nconfiguration. As mentioned above, there are multiple \\ndifferent flavors of Wi --Fi 7 MLO STAs, and as mentioned \\nmultiple, sometimes mutually exclusive potential benefits. As \\nan example, one way to achieve high transmission reliability \\nis to transmit the data on all available links. This scheme \\ndoes not allow, for example, to also gain the potential \\nthroughput benefit due to transmitting different data on each \\nlink. \\nAn interesting side effect of the proposed solution to the \\nWi-Fi 7 deployment challenges is that since the situation \\nalmost mandates  separating network s into Wi -Fi 7 networks \\nand legacy networks (which is technically not hard to \\nimplement), Wi -Fi 7 networks could find themselves in the  \\nunique position of not being burdened by the need to support \\nthe legacy devices with their idiosyncrasies, and allow the \\ndeployment of features that these older devices are \\nincompatible with, on the new Wi-Fi 7 dedicated network. \\nVII. BEYOND WI-FI 7 \\nWith Wi-Fi 7 technology nearing its market intercept, the \\nIEEE 802.11 work group (WG) has initiated a study group \\ntowards the next Wi -Fi generation following Wi -Fi 7. The \\nformation of the 802.11 Ultra High Reliability (UHR) study \\ngroup (SG) was approved in the IEEE 802.11 July 2022 \\nmeeting [9], and the Project Authorization Reques t (PAR) \\nand the Criteria for Standard Development (CSD) documents \\nwere developed an d finalized during the March 2023 SG \\nmeeting [10], with a target standard completion date o f \\nMarch 2027 . Considering that Wi -Fi 6 technology and \\nproducts were introduced in 2019, and with early Wi-Fi 7 \\nproducts introduced in 2023 , it is reasonable to assume that \\nthe next Wi -Fi generation, based on the UHR project will \\nindeed see a 2027 market intercept. \\nWhile traditionally each Wi-Fi standard generation brought \\nwith it a growth in the supported data rates, as shown in \\nsection V above, there are significant challenges to continue \\nthis trend.

This can be taken as a hint that \\nUHR specifications may generalize the Wi -Fi 7 MLO \\nframework to support links that do not necessarily terminate \\nin the same MLD, rather at the network level. If this indeed is \\nthe case, then the Wi-Fi 7 MLO will become the foundation \\nof a new paradigm that may enable further growth in Wi -Fi \\nperformance in the current bands of operation. \\nIn addition to considering the existing bands of operation \\nthe UHR SG also considered the inclusion of mmWave band \\nsupport as part of the upcoming standard. This concept was \\neventually rejected [10] and instead a proposal for the \\nformation of a new, dedicated study group was approved.  \\nWhile Wi-Fi operation in the unlicensed mmWave bands is \\npotentially already feasible through the IEEE 80 2.11ad and \\n802.11ay amendments, the new direction proposed for future \\n802.11 work on mmWave Wi -Fi is to integrate this band as \\nanother link in the overall MLO framework, further \\nemphasizing the importance of the framework for the future \\ngrowth of Wi-Fi. \\nVIII. SUMMARY \\nWi-Fi, being the predominant networking technology, has \\ndelivered an ever-increasing value to users over the past \\ndecades, with its 7 th generation, Wi-Fi 7, seeing early market \\nintercept as of early 2023. Wi-Fi 7 brings with it a significant \\nincrease in supported data rates and reduced latency, as well \\nas a paradigm shift . While still significantly improving the \\nper-channel link performance, Wi-Fi integrates multiple links \\ninto a single logical connection, with a potential to deliver \\nfurther throughput improvements as well as reduced latency, \\nand improved reliability.  At the same time, and given the \\nregulatory and constraints for unlicensed operation, it will be \\nmore than difficult for future Wi -Fi technologies to further \\nincrease link data rates beyond those available with Wi -Fi 7, \\nand future Wi -Fi generations will need to improve \\nperformance by extending Wi-Fi operation to new bands, and \\nby extending the multi-link framework with its potential f or \\nlink aggregation to relate to the complete network  as a virtual \\nmulti-link device. \\nAs with any technological evolution, Wi-Fi 7 brings with it \\nan extensive set of challenges in both device implementation \\nand network deployment  and configuration . As one of the \\nkey challenges relates to some device implementation s not \\nadhering to the forward compatible spirit of the standard, it \\nlooks as if there is a real need to configure Wi-Fi 7 capable \\nnetworks as two separate networks – one for legacy devices, \\nand the  other for Wi -Fi 7 (or other forward compatible) \\ndevices. This potentially problematic situation , if managed \\nproperly, may allow Wi-Fi 7 networks to increase the pace of \\nWi-Fi 7 innovation and implement features that otherwise \\nmight not have been deployed due to incompatibility of these \\nolder devices. \\nREFERENCES \\n[1] Cisco, “Cisco Annual Internet Report (2018 –2023) White \\nPaper,” March 2020  \\n[2] “Wi-Fi Alliance® delivers Wi -Fi 6E certification program ”, \\nWi-Fi Alliance, Jan 2021 \\n[3] C.

All rights reserved.  5 of 15 \\n320 MHz channel operations \\nIn many regulatory domains, 320 MHz channel operation is allowed  within the 6 \\nGHz unlicensed band . Wi-Fi 7 enables the operation of 320 MHz according to the \\nprotocols defined in IEEE 802.11be Draft 3.0. This increases the peak  modulation \\ncoding scheme (MCS) data rate from 2.409 Gbps in  Wi-Fi 6 to 5.7648 Gbps, \\nproviding higher multigigabit Wi -Fi device speeds for two spatial streams. It also \\ndoubles the maximum number of RUs that are available to an AP for allocation , \\nthus improving the  orthogonal frequency -division multiple access  (OFDMA) \\nefficiency in both uplinks and downlinks, enabling  a higher number of \\nsimultaneous transmissions at the fast est possible speeds. \\nMulti-link operation (MLO) \\nMulti-link operation in  Wi-Fi 7 allows devices to have connectivity on multiple links,  enabling a STA multi-link device  \\nto discover, authenticate, associate, and set up multiple links with an AP multi-link device. Each link enables channel \\naccess and frame exchanges between the STA multi-link device  and the AP multi-link device based on the supported \\ncapabilities exchanged during setup. Wi-Fi 7 through MLO provides throughput improvements, better reliability, \\nlower latency, and flexibility to STAs in terms of co-existence with other technologies, thus providing exceptional \\nperformance and user  experience. \\nWi-Fi 7 supports multiple modes of operation: Simultaneous Transmit and \\nReceive, Multi Link Single Radio and Enhanced Multi Link Single Radio,  and single \\nlink multi-link device  operation. In Simultaneous Transmit and Receive  operation, \\nthe devices are expected to be able to transmit and receive on each of the links \\nindependently and would attain the maximum performance.  \\nSince multiple links are established between an AP multi-link device  and a STA \\nmulti-link device , throughput can be increased by a factor of two or more. For \\nexample, an AP multi-link device  could support three radios and establish three \\nlinks with a STA multi-link device , one in 2.4 GHz with a bandwidth of 40 MHz and two spatial streams, one in 5 GHz \\nwith a bandwidth of 160 MHz and two spatial streams , and another one in 6 GHz with a bandwidth of 320 MHz and \\ntwo spatial streams. This would lead to an aggre gate maximum data rate of 2  X (344.1 Mbps + 1441.2 Mbps + \\n2882.4 Mbps) = 9.335 Gbps.  \\nMLO also allows each of the links in an AP multi-link device or STA multi-link device  to access the medium \\nsimultaneously and this means the amount of time a packet would spend in the transmit queue at the STA can be \\nreduced to as much of as half or even less. This in turn will reduce the latency and jitter in the system, especially \\nshortening the tail of the distribution.  \\nQoS can also be improved by using different links for different traffic and also by directing traffic to each of the links \\nbased on metrics such as  received signal strength indicator and signal-to-noise ratio  to use the links efficiently. \\nSimultaneous Transmit and Receive  provides dramatic improvements in throughput and latency . In many modern \\napplications (such as AR/VR), however, latency is critical even at lower throughputs. Wi -Fi 7 provides an alternative \\nthat gives preference to the latency improvements through the Enhanced Multi Link Single Radio  mode of \\noperation. Enhanced Multi Link Single Radio  is a mode that is used by the STA multi-link device  through an AP multi-\\nlink device assistance. The STA multi-link device has support for tw o radiofrequency (RF) links with only one spatial \\nstream (i.e., RF chain) support on each of the links, but can be switched to one RF link with two spatial streams \\nsupport. When in Enhanced Multi Link Single Radio  mode, the STA multi-link device  will be in a listening mode on \\nboth the links awaiting a trigger from AP multi-link device  through a Multi User Request to Send frame on any link \\nand when it does receive the Multi User Request to Send, the STA multi-link device  will switch both RF chains onto \\nthat link. \\nWi-Fi 7 MLO also supports Multi Link Single Radio  and single link mode devices. Multi Link Single Radio  allows \\ndevices to operate on multiple links  — but not simultaneously — and allows the device to hop from one link onto \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_7_Technology_Overview_202401_0.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance. All rights reserved.  6 of 15 \\nanother. This allows the device to be able to operate on multiple technologies. For example, the device may support \\nboth 5 GHz and 6 GHz, but not both simultaneously. The device may set up links on both bands, signal to the AP to \\nput the STA on one of the links in power save  mode and use the other for data transfer, but be ready to switch to \\nthe other channel should the load conditions change . The AP may need to do load balancing by switching the device \\nto operate the other channel for data transfer.  \\nMLO manageability features \\nOne attribute of MLO is that STAs associate on multiple links but are oftentimes awake on just one link in order to \\nmaximize battery life. Accordingly, they do not have optimal information about traffic levels across the links. The \\nsame situation arises in previous Wi -Fi generations where enterprise AP devices used available mechanisms such as \\nWi-Fi CERTIFIED Agile Multiband ™ to help STAs identify the best link for their traffic, especially in high density and \\ncongested environments. \\nWith Wi-Fi 7, AP devices are provided with modernized mechanisms to deliver this same service via the Basic Load \\nBalancing protocol. Basic Load Balancing provides more predictability and assurance and is a major improvement \\nover previous Wi-Fi generations in terms of responsiveness and the seamlessness of the link management since no \\n(Re)Association is required. \\nMLO can also provide the STA with sustained undisturbed connectivity even as the AP device performs disruptive \\noperations on an individual link or band (such as a software upgrade or when changing roles to a sniffer to help \\ntroubleshoot a connectivity issu e). Wi -Fi 7 offers the AP device two mechanisms for this purpose: AP multi -link \\ndevice reconfiguration for stateless operations and Advertised TID -to-Link Mapping for stateful operations.  \\n4K QAM \\nWi-Fi 7 introduces 4K QAM, raising the transmission rates by 20 percent at shorter ranges over Wi -Fi 6’s 1K QAM \\nwithout any increase in bandwidth or number of antennas. 4K QAM achieves the higher transmission rate by \\npacking four times more constellation points than 1K QAM.  \\nA higher transmission rate enables higher tr ansmission efﬁciency and improves \\nspectral efficiency, making better use of available bandwidth. 4K QAM helps support \\nflawless streaming of 4K/8K videos, playing massive online games without lags, or live \\nstreaming from a home computer. The enhanced spectr al efficiency is particularly \\nbeneficial in densely populated areas, where bandwidth is often at a premium. The \\nhigher data rate allows devices to finish transmissions more quickly, allowing more \\ndevices to efficiently share and operate in the same spectru m in the densely populated \\nareas. \\n512 compressed Block Ack \\nWi-Fi 7 introduces 512 compressed Block Ack, which allows the transmitter to \\naggregate up to 512 MAC Protocol Data Units  (MPDUs) in a single frame and allows \\nthe receiver to acknowledge up to 512 MPDUs in a single BA frame, as opposed to up \\nto 256 MPDUs in a single aggregation in Wi -Fi 6. 512 compressed Block Ack reduces \\nthe protocol overhead and can improve the transmitter’s performance when \\ntransmitting Wi -Fi 7 high throughput PHY rates using 320 MHz and MCS13 . \\nMultiple RUs to a single STA (M -RU) \\nWi-Fi 6 APs allocate only in contiguous RUs, which means that even \\nthough there are resources available for transmission, if the RUs can not \\nbe in a contiguous block, part of the bandwidth will be left unused , \\nresulting in loss of some efficiency. Wi -Fi 7 allows multiple RUs to be \\nassigned to a single user facilitating combined RUs for increased \\ntransmission efficiency. This in turn provides flexibility to fit the data, \\navoid interference, and further enhanc e spectral efficiency. \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_7_Technology_Overview_202401_0.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance. All rights reserved.  7 of 15 \\nTriggered uplink access optimization   \\nWi-Fi 6 added triggered access to improve the reliability and performance of the channel access , especially in \\ncongested environments. The Wi -Fi 6 triggered access was targeted for all applications, from best -effort data \\ntransmissions to real-time video and audio applications. Wi -Fi 7 APs are further improved to support low latency \\napplications using stream classification service  (SCS) procedure with QoS Characteristic element, as defined in IEEE \\n802.11be D3.0. \\nFor uplink latency -sensitive flows, SCS procedure allows client devices to inform APs \\nvia QoS Characteristics element of their desired triggered uplink access interval, \\nminimum data rate, delay bound, and other optional information for the duration of \\nthe traffic flow. This helps the AP schedule triggered uplink access more efficiently  \\nand improves spectrum efficiency by eliminating channel access overhead from \\nmultiple STA devices. Additionally, it reduces the overhead from the necessary buffer \\nstatus polling and reports by taking advantage of the periodic traffic pattern of the \\nflows. \\nEmergency Preparedness Communication Service  \\nEPCS features are specified in Wi -Fi 7 to support priority access to the wireless medium for \\nauthorized stations supporting the NSEP Communications. The Wi -Fi CERTIFIED 7 APs with \\nEPCS capability advertise the priority access capabilities via Beacon and Probe Response \\nmessages. The Wi -Fi CERTIFIED 7 STAs with EPCS capability associate with the Wi -Fi 7 APs \\nto obtain priority channel access. Both APs and STAs can enable and disable the priority \\naccess securely via the following process:   \\n• EPCS Priority Access Invocation: Using a request message, both AP and STA can invoke the priority access \\nfeatures. When a STA invokes the priority access features,  the AP verifies the authorization information \\nbefore granting the priority access via a response message. The authorization can be performed through \\nthe use of a remote entity server connected to the AP via an external interface (e.g. , using a Subscription \\nService Provider Network interface to an Authentication Authorization and Accounting  server). This will \\nensure that priority functionality is restricted to those with a critical need  \\n• EPCS Priority Access Revocation: When the priority treatment is no longer needed (e.g. , when the congestion \\neases), the STA or the AP can disable EPCS priority access by sending a teardown message  \\nThe EPCS features that give users priority channel access are built upon the Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Wi-Fi Multimedia™ \\n(WMM®) concepts used to apply suitable relative priority to various types of media (e.g. , voice, video, and best -effort \\ndata). WMM defines a set of channel access parameters for each media type or access category. The EPCS priority \\naccess mechanism allows the AP to assign different sets of parameters to devices that are authorized to use the \\nEPCS priority access feature. The mechanism ensures that those parameters increase NSEP users’ EPCS -capable \\ndevices’ likelihood of gaining access to the wireless medium co mpared to other devices. In this way, the EPCS \\npriority access retains  the advantages of WMM in enabling multimedia services while at the same time providing an \\nadvantage for users with NSEP responsibilities when networks are congested.  \\nSecurity \\nWi-Fi 7 requires Wi-Fi CERTIFIED WPA3 ™ to protect communications between Wi -Fi 7 \\ndevices. WPA3 security for  Wi-Fi 7 devices has been extended to make use of stronger key \\nmanagement. In addition to mandating Protected Management Frames, Wi -Fi 7 devices are \\nmandated to support beacon protection, a mechanism that allows a device to \\ncryptographically verify the cont ents of beacon frames transmitted by an AP.  \\nWi-Fi 7 requires support for Wi Fi CERTIFIED Enhanced Open ™ between Wi-Fi 7 devices in \\nopen networks. Wi -Fi Enhanced Open networks provide unauthenticated data encryption to \\nusers, an improvement over traditional open networks with no protections at all. These \\nprotections are transparent to the user.  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_7_Technology_Overview_202401_0.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance.

Video is a particularly demanding medium and plays a large role in many of these \\nuse cases, as does processing large data loads. Wi -Fi 7 provides the needed capacity to handle these intensive \\nscenarios and enable the rich experiences sought across the home and enterprise environments.   \\n \\nStreaming ultra-high definition video  \\nVideo dominates today’s Internet, and this trend is expected \\nto continue into the foreseeable future. As internet video \\ntraffic soars both in use and in higher resolution, so do user \\nexpectations regarding video quality.  \\nInternet video service providers like Netflix, Prime,  and Disney \\nare challenged with providing a high standard of video quality \\nbalanced with a massive amount of data throughput required \\nto deliver high definition (HD) and ultra-high definition (UHD) \\nstreams to consumers. The success of this video streaming \\nbalance lies in 1) powerful compression methods, 2) fast, \\nreliable end-to-end internet access, and 3) adapting to lower \\nvideo quality if the available link throughput plunges or does \\nnot stream content w ith a resolution supported by a screen’s capability.  \\nConsumers want reliable, high -quality video. However streaming HD and UHD video over Wi -Fi is a formidable \\nchallenge for both internet content providers and internet service providers. While content can be compressed to \\nreduce the delivery rate , the inherent variability in the throughput of the Wi -Fi environment has the most impact on \\nvideo quality.

Network \\nperformance parameters are typically judged by their performance in a wireless environment, such as over Wi -Fi. \\nThe goal of ABR streaming algorithms over the last decade has been to maximize achi evable video quality based on \\nthe variance in the underlying network throughput. These algorithms  operate by estimating network conditions and \\nadapting video quality profiles based on available network resources.  \\nUsing “Top Gun: Maverick” 4K UHD at 60 fps at 3840 x 2160 for example:  \\n• The native baseband or uncompressed production bitrate is 12 Gb ps  \\n• Once encoded for distribution on physical media such as Blue-Ray, the bitrate is 90 Mbps  \\n• Internet content providers will do further compression for ABR streaming for best effort HD and UHD video \\nquality. Streaming service bitrate ranges between 375 Kbps and 40 Mbps depending on network quality    \\nWi-Fi 7 materially elevates the internet streaming experience because the inherent improvements in near zero \\nlatency, MLO modes, and removed congestion eliminate almost all network performance adversities often found in \\nthe Wi-Fi link impeding best bitrate profile playback offered by internet video providers.

These include reducing the likelihood of \\ndisruption in data exchange s, increasing the range and robustness of an uplink, and improving QoS predictability \\nand consistency of experience for QoS -sensitive applications. \\nSome of the challenges that need to be addressed to fully \\nrealize the potential of wireless technologies in the \\nautomotive industry  include: \\n• Wireless technologies must be highly reliable and \\nsecure to ensure the safety of drivers and \\npassengers. Any failure or disruption in \\ncommunication could have serious consequences in \\na vehicle. In particular for audio/visual (AV) \\napplications, users expect  wireline QoE for \\nmultimedia \\n• Automotive environments are noisy and congested, \\nwith many devices competing for limited bandwidth. Interference and congestion can impact the reliability \\nand speed of wireless communications  \\n• Automotive applications, such as autonomous driving, require low latency communications. Any delay in \\ncommunication can affect the ability of the vehicle to make real -time decisions.  This is especially true for \\nactuators, which need wire-like responses , and for AV applications AVB/TSN/AVnu (802.1BA  and 802.1AS), \\nwhich require very low latency \\n• Security is emerging as a key requirement in  the automotive space. I n the case of AV applications ( intra-\\nvehicle), encryption for content protection is highly likely to be required. The security requirements for \\nactuators and sensors are also very high \\n• Many automotive devices are battery -powered, and power consumption is a critical factor in their design. \\nWireless technologies that consume a lot of power can reduce battery life and increase maintenance costs  \\nTo address these challenges, wireless technologies in the automotive industry are being developed and optimized \\nto meet the unique demands of this environment. Wi -Fi 7 technologies offer faster speeds, greater bandwidth, and \\nlower latency, making them well -suited for automotive applications.  \\nHybrid work and rich telepresence  \\nIn a post-pandemic world, many companies allow \\nemployees to work from anywhere or they require in -office \\nwork only two or three days per week.  Video has become \\nthe preferred method of telecommunication  in business \\nand can add efficiency to enterprises by enhancing \\ncollaboration and strengthening working relationships.

Coverage, capacity, and \\nreliability are key metrics.  In the home, the environment is characterized by strong interference from unmanaged \\noverlapping wireless networks from other unlicensed technologies in the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands, and in \\nthe case of multiple dwelling units, from OBSS interference. Reliable low latency Wi -Fi connectivity is a must for \\nproductive remote work.

Any sustained deviation will cause “video down -speeding” which lead s to a poor \\nuser experience. \\nRemote work would not be possible without rapid development of Wi -Fi technology. The latest Wi-Fi 7 technology \\nhas MLO and triggered uplink  access optimization using SCS and QoS Characteristics features to minimize \\ndistortions and provide sustained high throughput and low latency in the presence of strong interference in the 2.4 \\nGHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands . MLO enables Wi -Fi 7 to tolerate even long times when a link is busy. In these cases, \\nthe transmissions may be done at  a different band or channel. The t riggered uplink optimization makes sure that \\nuplink transmissions are done continuously at the correct time.  \\nAs a result, remote meetings become distortion -free and participants sense that they are present together within \\nthe meeting. \\nHybrid work requires that information be easily available, and that employees be contacted within seconds. Today, \\ninformation and messages are available on multiple devices, laptops, phones, watches, etc.  \\n• Getting a copy of  a message to all devices ensures that urgent messages are responded  to promptly. A quick \\nresponse shows that the received message and the sender are important    \\n• Employers can cooperate to create the same document in real time  \\n• Information is easily available. Huge files can be downloaded within seconds  \\nIn the home, video conferencing has also proven to be the preferred mode of remote communication when \\nindividuals connect with family and friends, and  the same Wi-Fi 7 network can be used for videos, gaming, \\nschoolwork, and connecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices to the Internet. Even if the traffic load of all \\nsimultaneous transmissions is high, the reliability, ease, and speed of remote work is no t compromised. This is \\nachieved by triggering optimizations and the MLO framework of the Wi -Fi 7 network. Video applications are \\nexpected to continue to grow rapidly, and Wi -Fi 7 will ensure that Wi -Fi can handle the expected growth in video \\ntraffic, including video calling and conferencing applications.  \\nImmersive gaming and entertainment  \\nAR, VR, and XR are redefining the limits of immersion for gaming \\nand entertainment by simulating real -life experiences and \\nconverging the physical and digital worlds. Players can enjoy \\ntruly immersive in -game experiences with a rich first -person \\nperspective and explore an endless variety of digital \\nenvironments through their HMDs and other XR devices and \\ninteract with them in real -time via controllers and other \\naccessories. Cloud gaming further expands the possibilities and \\npotential of mobile gaming by sh ifting most computing to \\nremote servers. This enables XR and mobile devices to deliver \\nthe same immersive gaming experience and high -fidelity \\ngraphics with low power consumption and reduced on -device \\ncompute, reducing the overall cost of gaming platforms. \\nDelivering these rich experiences, however, demands wireless connectivity with very high throughput and low \\nlatency and jitter sustained throughout gaming sessions to ensure high responsiveness and high -resolution \\ngraphics. \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/WiFi 7/Wi-Fi_CERTIFIED_7_Technology_Overview_202401_0.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content=' \\n© 2024 Wi-Fi Alliance.

Public users may be communicating over those same networks. The \\nonslaught in traffic from the public use rs, as they attempt to contact loved ones or alert colleagues, congests the   \\nWi-Fi access network . \\nIf the public users’ traffic congests the Wi -Fi access network, authorized emergency responders ( i.e., NSEP users) \\nmay find their communications to be impaired, potentially preventing them from responding effectively. A Wi -Fi \\nnetwork that offered priority access to such authorized users would help ensure that they could perform their \\nmission-critical acti vities despite the network congestion.  \\nWith Wi-Fi 7’s capability of supporting priority access to authorized devices, service providers can offer NSEP priority \\nservices to emergency personnel similar to those offered in cellular networks to allow them  to effectively \\ncommunicate even when the network is congested. This will ensure that NSEP authorized users can stay connected \\nand perform their missions that will result in saving human lives.  \\nIndustrial Internet of Things \\nIndustrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to the application of IoT technologies and concepts to industrial settings \\nsuch as manufacturing, logistics, energy, and transportation. In IIoT, an ecosystem of devices, sensors, actuators, \\napplications, and associated networking equipment  or devices are connected to each other and to the Internet, \\nworking together to collect, monitor, and analyze data from industrial operations. This allows real -time monitoring \\nand control of industrial processes. The data colle cted from these devices can be analyzed to identify patterns, \\noptimize processes, and improve efficiency.  \\nIIoT enables new business models, such as predictive \\nmaintenance, where machines are serviced before they fail, \\nrather than after. It can also facilitate the integration of \\ndifferent systems and processes, such as supply chain \\nmanagement and production pla nning, leading to greater \\nvisibility and efficiency across the organization . \\nThere are several challenges that wireless technologies face in \\nthe context of IIoT: \\n• Industrial systems require high levels of reliability and \\nsecurity, and wireless technologies may not always \\nprovide the necessary levels of protection against interference, signal loss, or cyber -attacks \\n• Wireless signals can be affected by interference from other wireless devices or sources of electromagnetic \\nradiation, such as machinery or power lines, which can cause signal degradation and connectivity issues .  \\nWi-Fi 7 helps with interference by making use of the 6 GHz band  \\n• Industrial environments can be large and complex, with a lot of physical obstacles that can block or weaken \\nwireless signals, making it difficult to provide reliable coverage throughout the facility  \\n• Industrial applications often require low latency, which is the time it takes for a signal to travel from one \\npoint to another. Wireless technologies may introduce latency due to the need for signal processing, \\ntransmission, and reception  \\n• Many industrial IoT devices are battery -powered and need to operate for long periods without recharging. \\nWireless technologies can consume a lot of power, which can reduce battery life and increase maintenance \\ncosts \\nTo overcome these challenges, wireless technologies must be designed keeping IIoT applications in mind.

IEEE 802.11be introduces a\\nmulti-link device (MLD) that has several radios and use sev-\\neral frequency channels simultaneously.

The highest gains are achieved\\nwhen an MLD can use the channels independently, e.g., trans-\\nmitting data on one while receiving data on the other (so-\\ncalled Simultaneous Transmit and Receive mode, STR). Un-\\nfortunately, radio filters are not ideal and some power may\\nleak from the transmitting channel to the neighboring ones,\\nwhich induces inter-channel interference (ICI).\\nThe ICI level depends on the quality of radio filters. The\\nstandard spectral mask limits the power leakage in the neigh-\\nboring channels by −20 . . .−40 dB, which makes it negligible\\nfor the devices located far from the transmitter. That is why\\nICI is not typically considered in many papers evaluating the\\nperformance of Wi-Fi. However, for small distances between\\ntwo radios within the same MLD, the ICI prevents the device\\nfrom receiving data on one link while transmitting on the\\nother. As small smartphones will hardly eliminate the ICI,\\nthe standard introduces a non-STR (NSTR) mode, where the\\nMLD needs to synchronize the transmission and reception of\\nthe data on various links, at the cost of reduced throughput\\nmore complicated channel access procedure.\\nPrevious studies on ICI for outdated devices produced\\nmore than ten years ago [2, 3] mainly conclude that there\\nare the thresholds in the distance between the devices and in\\nthe spectral distance between the channels, which determine\\nif the radios work independently or the transmission blocks\\nthe reception. These conclusions are supported by Draft 2.0\\nof IEEE 802.11be, which defines two modes of MLO: STR and\\nNSTR. However, in [4], with software-defined radios (SDR),\\nwe found that the effect is not binary: in a large area the\\nMLD can operate as STR but requires the receiving data to\\nbe transmitted with a lower Modulation and Coding Scheme\\n(MCS). As the properties of SDR may differ from radios used\\nin modern off-the-shelf devices, in this demo paper, we ex-\\nperimentally study this effect with off-the-shelf smartphones.\\nAs no Wi-Fi 7 devices are available on the market yet, we\\nemulate MLO with modern smartphones and APs.\\n2 TESBED DESCRIPTION\\nTo evaluate the conditions when STR MLO is possible, we\\ncreate a testbed, shown in Fig. 1. A client MLD communicates\\nto an STR AP MLD using two channels in the 5GHz band.

Two radios of the client MLD are\\nemulated with two smartphones (Huawei P40 and OnePlus 6,\\ndenoted as STA1 and STA2). AP1 transmit data to STA1 in the\\nfirst (downlink) channel of width 𝑊1 and central frequency\\n𝑓1. STA2 transmits data to AP2 in the second (uplink) channel\\nof width 𝑊2 and center frequency 𝑓2. This transmission can\\nprevent the successful reception of the frame in the first\\nchannel because of the ICI.\\nAll devices support bandwidth up to 80 MHz. Beamform-\\ning and MIMO are switched off. We install additional soft-\\nware on the devices to generate saturated UDP traffic in both\\nchannels with frame payload of 1000 bytes. We use an addi-\\ntional laptop in monitor mode to control the saturation of\\ntraffic in the uplink channel, which generates the main ISI.\\nDuring the experiment, we vary 𝑊2, but bandwidth\\n𝑊1 = 20 MHz is fixed because preliminary tests have shown\\nthat otherwise AP1 adaptively reduces it if the ICI is strong.\\nLet the STAs be located at 𝑑 = 30 cm from each other,\\nwhich corresponds to the typical size of a laptop. Figure 2\\nshows the dependence of downlink throughput on spec-\\ntral distance\\nΔ𝑓 = 𝑎𝑏𝑠 (𝑓1 −𝑓2)between the channels. The\\nthroughput completely restores to an interference-free level\\nwhen the spectral distance exceeds 125 MHz. The results\\nfully correspond to the previous studies and to the behavior\\nFigure 3: Downlink throughput for𝑑 = 13 cm.\\nassumed in the Wi-Fi 7 standard, i.e., low Δ𝑓 , corresponds\\nto the NSTR mode, and high Δ𝑓 allows the STR mode.\\nThis conclusion is not valid if the distance between STAs\\nis 𝑑 = 13 cm, which corresponds to the typical size of smart-\\nphones, see Fig. 3. Even when the spectral distance exceeds\\n300 MHz, the throughput reduction is about 30% because\\nof severe near-field ICI. Though the client MLD can trans-\\nmit and receive simultaneously, the AP MLD shall select a\\nmore robust MCS if the client MLD transmits some data in\\nthe uplink in the other channel. In our experiments, the ICI\\nfrom STA2 on STA1 is stable, so the rate control algorithm\\nselects an appropriate MCS automatically. However, in real\\nlife, the AP shall get some information from the STA about\\nthe required MCS reduction depending on the used bands.\\n3 DEMONSTRATION\\nDuring our demo, we will show the effects described above.\\nAlso, we are going to collect more results with other devices\\nof participants. We kindly ask the organizer to provide us\\nwith a power supply and a table for the demo setup. We also\\nneed to deploy two APs 10–20m from the table.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\\nThe research has been carried out at IITP RAS and supported\\nby the Russian Science Foundation (Grant No 20-19-00788,\\nhttps://rscf.ru/en/project/20-19-00788/)\\nREFERENCES\\n[1]\\nE.

As such, all unicast messages (uplink or downlink) are encrypted by the 148 \\nLoRaWAN MAC layer using the end-device’s AppSKey. 149 \\n 150 \\nThis protocol specification allows a Certification test harness to fully validate compliance of 151 \\nthe end-device to the LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification [TS001-1.0.4] and the LoRaWAN 152 \\nRegional Parameters Specification [RP002-1.0.1] for Class A end devices. 153 \\n 154 \\n 155 \\nIn order for an end-device to be designated “LoRaWAN CertifiedCM” it SHALL 156 \\nimplement this application layer specification and have the FPort 224 enabled for the 157 \\nduration of the Certification tests. This application SHALL be disabled on any device 158 \\nin production, otherwise it may be intentionally or accidentally be activated to harm 159 \\nthe device itself or the networks in its radio coverage. 160 \\n 161 \\n 162 \\nThe end-device to be certified SHALL be sent to the Authorized Test House (ATH) with the 163 \\nFPort enabled for the Certification test, then returned to the end-device manufacturer for 164 \\nthe FPort to be disabled. 165 \\n 166 \\n 167 \\nFlow chart for process   168 \\n 169 \\nFigure 1: Certification Process Flow Chart 170 \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/TS009-LoRaWAN_Certification_Protocol_v1.0.0.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content=' \\nLoRaWAN Certification Protocol Specification  \\n \\n©2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 7 of 20 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n 171 \\nWhen an OTAA device has connected to the Test Control Layer (TCL refer to Chapter 3) 172 \\nafter the Join-Request and Join-Accept frame exchange the device SHOULD send an uplink 173 \\nmessage as soon as possible. 174 \\n 175 \\nWhen an ABP device has connected to the (TCL) there SHALL be a way to trigger an uplink 176 \\nmessage. 177 \\n2.1 Scope of LoRaWAN Certification 178 \\nThe scope of this specification is limited to validating compliant implementation of the 179 \\nLoRaWAN protocol. 180 \\nIntended or otherwise, the inevitable variability of performance and quality of the radio 181 \\nimplementation among end-devices is too high to allow normalized, practical evaluation. RF 182 \\nperformance measurement, whether radiated or conducted, which are therefore considered 183 \\nout of scope of the tests described herein. Subsequently, all methodologies describing RF 184 \\nprovisioning or adjustments (e.g. device attenuation, etc.) are intentionally absent. It is the 185 \\nshared responsibility of the Authorized Test Houses and those parties seeking certification to 186 \\nbest accommodate the submitted end-device RF characteristics for LoRaWAN protocol 187 \\ncertification.  This is intended to optimize reliability and consistency of bi-directional 188 \\ncommunication of the test harness. 189 \\n2.2 LoRaWAN Certification Process 190 \\nFor details of the LoRaWAN Certification Process see: 191 \\nhttps://lora-alliance.org/lorawan-certification 192 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/TS009-LoRaWAN_Certification_Protocol_v1.0.0.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content=' \\nLoRaWAN Certification Protocol Specification  \\n \\n©2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 8 of 20 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n3 Functional Test Description for LoRaWAN Certification 193 \\nThe list of tests specified on Regional Certification documents reflect functional requirements 194 \\nof an end-device as defined by the targeted LoRaWAN Specification. The tests are conducted 195 \\nin a test harness generally comprised of:  196 \\n \\n   \\nFigure 2: Test Harness Architecture \\n• A Test Control Layer [TCL] \\n• A LoRaWAN Network Server [NS] \\n• A LoRa gateway [GW] \\n• The end-device Under Test [DUT] \\nImplementation of this harness architecture is expected to vary among test houses. The Test 197 \\nControl Layer [ TCL] is assumed to be a framework of automated scripts and tools that 198 \\nmanipulates the LoRaWAN Network Server [NS] to facilitate the tests. Specifically, the TCL 199 \\ndrives events in the harness, controlling application and network-control content of downlinks. 200 \\nIt also decrypts, inspects and validates content of uplinks sent by the DUT. This allows test 201 \\ncoverage to include: 202 \\n• Cryptography 203 \\n• Timing of the DUT Receive Windows 204 \\n• Frequency Channel usage and Data Rate adaptation 205 \\n• Maximum Payload length handling 206 \\n 207 \\nFor brevity, this document makes procedural reference to only the TCL, NS, GW and DUT. 208 \\nThe LoRa WAN gateway [ GW] and DUT are collocated in an RF -isolated environment, 209 \\nprovisioned as necessary for reliable bi-directional communication. It is nonetheless expected 210 \\nthat both the DUT and GW will not receive every  frame intended for reception. The TCL 211 \\nSHOULD make reasonable effort to accommodate this inevitability. 212 \\nThe DUT is required to implement this LoRaWAN Certification Protocol Specification in order 213 \\nto provide a way to control DUT application. The RF-isolated environment mentioned above 214 \\nSHOULD mitigate any potential interference. 215 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/TS009-LoRaWAN_Certification_Protocol_v1.0.0.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content=' \\nLoRaWAN Certification Protocol Specification  \\n \\n©2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 9 of 20 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n 216 \\nTesting occurs to certify the DUT for each supported activation method, be it over -the-air 217 \\nactivation (OTAA), activation-by-personalized (ABP), or both. 218 \\nBetween each test section described in specific regional documents, the TCL will return the 219 \\nDUT to a known state. 220 \\nThe TCL SHALL verify the following throughout the course of this Certification test suite: 221 \\n• The DUT uplink frames size SHALL respect the maximum allowed uplink frame size 222 \\nfor the data rate currently in use. 223 \\n• The size of the DUT’s uplink frames SHALL match the expected content to ensure no 224 \\nextraneous and unnecessary content is present. 225 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/TS009-LoRaWAN_Certification_Protocol_v1.0.0.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content=' \\nLoRaWAN Certification Protocol Specification  \\n \\n©2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 10 of 20 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n4 End-Device Certification Description 226 \\n4.1 Overview 227 \\nEvery LoRaWAN end-device SHALL implement this applicative protocol specification in its 228 \\napplication layer. This allows the test harness to fully validate compliance of the end-229 \\ndevice’s LoRaWAN MAC layer implementation. 230 \\nThe Port Field (FPort) value 224 is dedicated to the LoRaWAN MAC layer certification 231 \\nprotocol.  232 \\nThe DUT SHALL return to its normal application behaviour by a command disabling 233 \\ncertification FPort 224 processing. Additionally, the DUT SHALL be reset with a dedicated 234 \\ncommand, returning to a join state from which it can then establish a new session. 235 \\nAll defined test commands SHALL be sent by TCL to the DUT using FPort 224 when the 236 \\nend-device is in its normal operation. The DUT SHOULD execute the given command as 237 \\nsoon as possible. 238 \\n4.1.1 Over-The-Air Activated DUT 239 \\nWhen the DUT is first powered up if it uses OTAA it SHOULD join the network by issuing a 240 \\nJoin-request, the TCL will respond with Join -accept. For best practice operation of the 241 \\nCertification process, upon receipt of the Join -accept frame the DUT SHOULD then send a 242 \\n(possibly empty) uplink frame. The TCL is then able to send certification test commands on 243 \\nFPort 224 if enabled. 244 \\n4.1.2 Activated by Personalization DUT 245 \\nA Personalized DUT is one that comes with session keys pre -programmed.  The 246 \\npersonalization information SHALL be supplied to the Test House. When the DUT is first 247 \\npowered on, it SHOULD send an uplink frame. The TCL is then able to send certification test 248 \\ncommands on FPort 224 if enabled. 249 \\n4.2 Certification Commands 250 \\n4.2.1 Downlink Counter 251 \\nThe DUT creates a 16 -bit unsigned counter (called RxAppCnt) which is incremented each 252 \\ntime the DUT receives an applicative downlink frame (FPort > 0). An empty downlink frame 253 \\nwith FCtrl ACK bit set SHALL be considered as and applicative downlink. 254 \\nThe RxAppCnt counter SHALL be initialized to 0 when DUT is reset or each time the TCL 255 \\nsends a DownlinkCntRstReq command on FPort 224. 256 \\n4.2.2 Commands handling 257 \\nThe TCL MAY send the certification application commands at any given time.

The Radio Gateway operates entirely at the physical layer. 229 \\nIts role is simply to decode uplink radio packets from the air and forward them unprocessed to 230 \\nthe Network Server. Conversely, for downlinks, the Radio Gateway simply executes transmission 231 \\nrequests coming from the Network Server without any interpretation of the payload. 232 \\n 233 \\n 234 \\nNetwork Server: 235 \\n 236 \\nThe Network Server (NS) terminates the LoRaWAN MAC layer for the End-Devices connected to 237 \\nthe network. It is the center of the star topology. Each NS is identified by a unique NSID (an 238 \\nIEEE EUI64 identifier), and can be configured with one or more NetIDs. 239 \\n 240 \\nGeneric features of NS are: 241 \\n• End-Device address check, 242 \\n• Frame authentication and frame counter checks, 243 \\n• Acknowledgements, 244 \\n• Data rate adaptation, 245 \\n• Responding to all MAC layer requests coming from the End-Device, 246 \\n• Forwarding uplink application payloads to the appropriate Application Servers, 247 \\n• Queuing of downlink payloads coming from any Application Server to any End-Device 248 \\nconnected to the network, 249 \\n• Forwarding Join-request and Join-accept messages between the End-Devices and the 250 \\nJoin Servers.  251 \\n 252 \\nIn a roaming architecture, an NS may play three different roles depending on whether the End-253 \\nDevice is in roaming situation or not, and the type of roaming that is involved. 254 \\n 255 \\nServing NS (sNS) controls the MAC layer of the End-Device. 256 \\n 257 \\nHome NS (hNS) is where Device Profile, Service Profile, Routing Profile and DevEUI of the End-258 \\nDevice are stored. hNS has a direct relation with the Join Server that will be used for the Join 259 \\nProcedure. It is connected to the Application Server (AS). When hNS and sNS are separated, 260 \\nthey are in a roaming agreement. Uplink and downlink packets are forwarded between the sNS 261 \\nand the hNS. 262 \\n 263 \\nForwarding NS (fNS) is the NS managing the Radio Gateways. When sNS and fNS are 264 \\nseparated, they are in a roaming agreement. There may be one or more fNS serving the End-265 \\nDevice. Uplink and downlink packets are forwarded between the fNS and the sNS. 266 \\n 267 \\n 268 \\nJoin Server: 269 \\n 270 \\nThe Join Server (JS) manages the Over-the-Air (OTA) End-Device activation process. There 271 \\nmay be several JSs connected to a NS, and a JS may connect to several NSs.  272 \\n 273 \\nThe End-Device signals which JS should be interrogated through the JoinEUI field of the Join-274 \\nrequest message. Each JS is identified by a unique JoinEUI value. Note that AppEUI field of the 275 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/TS002-1.1.0_LoRaWAN_Backend_Interfaces.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content=' \\nTS2-1.1.0 LoRaWAN Backend Interfaces \\n \\n©2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 10 of 85 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\nJoin-request in LoRaWAN 1.0/1.0.2 [LW10, LW102] is renamed to JoinEUI field in LoRaWAN 1.1 276 \\n[LW11]. The term JoinEUI is used to refer to the AppEUI in the context of LoRaWAN 1.0/1.0.2 277 \\nEnd-Devices in this specification. 278 \\n 279 \\nThe JS knows the End-Device’s Home Network Server identifier and provides that information to 280 \\nthe other Network Servers when required by the roaming procedures. 281 \\n 282 \\nThe JS contains the required information to process uplink Join-request frames and generate the 283 \\ndownlink Join-accept frames. It also performs the network and application session key 284 \\nderivations. It communicates the Network Session Key of the End-Device to the NS, and the 285 \\nApplication Session Key to the corresponding Application Server. 286 \\n 287 \\nFor that purpose the JS SHALL contain the following information for each End-Device under its 288 \\ncontrol : 289 \\n• DevEUI 290 \\n• AppKey  291 \\n• NwkKey (only applicable to LoRaWAN 1.1 End-Device) 292 \\n• Home Network Server identifier 293 \\n• Application Server identifier 294 \\n• A way to select the preferred network in case several networks can serve the End-Device 295 \\n• LoRaWAN version of the End-device (LoRaWAN 1.0, 1.0.2, or 1.1) 296 \\n 297 \\nThe root keys NwkKey and AppKey are only available in the JS and the End-Device, and they 298 \\nare never sent to the NS nor the AS.  299 \\n 300 \\nSecure provisioning, storage, and usage of root keys NwkKey and AppKey on the End-Device 301 \\nand the backend are intrinsic to the overall security of the solution. These are left to 302 \\nimplementation and out of scope of this document. However, elements of this solution may 303 \\ninclude SE (Secure Elements) and HSM (Hardware Security Modules).  304 \\n 305 \\nThe way those information are actually programmed into the JS is outside the scope of this 306 \\ndocument and may vary from one JS to another.

Home NS is the NS that holds 448 \\nthe End-Device, Service, and Routing Profiles of the End-Device, and interfaces with the AS and 449 \\nthe JS after any activation. The mechanism used for provisioning the Home NS with the required 450 \\nprofile information is outside the scope of this specification. On the other hand, Visited NS is any 451 \\nother NS that has a business and technical agreement with the Home NS for being able to serve 452 \\nthe End-Device. 453 \\n 454 \\nThere are two variants of the Activation Procedure, namely Activation at Home, and Roaming 455 \\nActivation. 456 \\n 457 \\nActivation at Home: The End-Device performs the Activation Procedure within the radio coverage 458 \\nof the Home NS. At the end of the procedure, the Home NS is the only NS serving the End-459 \\nDevice for reaching out to the AS and the JS. 460 \\n 461 \\nRoaming Activation: The End-Device performs the Activation Procedure outside the radio 462 \\ncoverage of its Home NS but within the coverage of a Visited NS. In this procedure, the Visited 463 \\nNS learns the identity of the Home NS with the help of the JS and obtains the required End-464 \\nDevice and Service Profiles from the Home NS. At the end of the procedure, the End-Device is 465 \\nserved by both the Visited NS and the Home NS for reaching out to the AS and the JS. 466 \\n 467 \\nWhen the End-Device performs a successful Join or Rejoin Procedure, the End-Device is said to 468 \\nhave a LoRa session with the backend. Each LoRa session is associated with a set of context 469 \\nparameters managed on the End-Device, and the NS, JS, and AS. (e.g., session keys, DevAddr, 470 \\nID of NS, etc.). The LoRa session terminates when the End-Device performs Deactivation (Exit) 471 \\nProcedure or another successful Join/Rejoin Procedure. 472 \\n 473 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/TS002-1.1.0_LoRaWAN_Backend_Interfaces.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content=' \\nTS2-1.1.0 LoRaWAN Backend Interfaces \\n \\n©2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 17 of 85 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n8 OTA Activation at Home Procedure 474 \\n 475 \\nFigure 5. illustrates the message flow for OTA Activation at Home Procedure.

LoRa Session and the MAC-layer control of the End-Device are maintained by the 604 \\nformer NS, which is called the Serving NS (sNS), whereas the frame forwarding to/from air 605 \\ninterface is handled by the latter NS, which is called the Forwarding NS (fNS). There can only be 606 \\none sNS for a given LoRa Session whereas zero or more fNSs may be involved with the same 607 \\nsession.  608 \\n 609 \\nThere are two types of fNSs: Stateful and stateless. A stateful fNS creates context at the onset of 610 \\nthe passive roaming of an End-Device and utilizes that context for processing any subsequent 611 \\nuplink/downlink packets of the same End-Device. A stateless fNS does not create any such 612 \\ncontext and therefore ends up having to process any uplink/downlink packet independent of each 613 \\nother. It is assumed that whether a given fNS is stateless or stateful is known to its roaming 614 \\npartners by some out of scope mechanism. 615 \\n 616 \\nHandover Roaming enables the transfer of the MAC-layer control from one NS to another. hNS 617 \\nmaintains the control-plane and data-plane with the JS and the AS even after the End-Device 618 \\nperforms a Handover Roaming from one NS to another.  hNS stays the same for a given LoRa 619 \\nSession until the End-Device performs the next Join Procedure. Unlike the fNS, the sNS has 620 \\ncapability to control the End-Device RF settings, which allows more flexible roaming scenarios. 621 \\n  622 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/TS002-1.1.0_LoRaWAN_Backend_Interfaces.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content=' \\nTS2-1.1.0 LoRaWAN Backend Interfaces \\n \\n©2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 23 of 85 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n 623 \\nFigure 6 Use of Handover and Passive Roaming 624 \\n 625 \\nFigure 6 illustrates an example case where both the Handover Roaming and Passive Roaming 626 \\nare used for a LoRa Session simultaneously. In this example, the End-Device was activated 627 \\nthrough NS1 which acts as the hNS. Subsequently, the End-Device has performed Handover 628 \\nRoaming from NS1 to NS2 when NS2 became the sNS, and also Passive Roaming from NS2 to 629 \\nNS3 when NS3 became the fNS for the End-Device.  630 \\n 631 \\nRoaming activation is the capability for an End-Device to activate under the coverage of a Visited 632 \\nNS. 633 \\n 634 \\nThis specification describes the procedures for the following roaming cases: 635 \\n- Passive Roaming during an ongoing LoRa Session 636 \\n- Handover Roaming during an ongoing LoRa Session 637 \\n- Roaming Activation of a new LoRa Session based on Handover Roaming between the 638 \\nHome NS and the Visited NS 639 \\n- Roaming Activation of a new LoRa Session based on Passive Roaming between the 640 \\nHome NS and the Visited NS  641 \\n 642 \\nActivation of a new LoRa Session when the Home NS and the Visited NS do not have any 643 \\nroaming agreement is outside the scope of this specification. This includes the case where the 644 \\ntwo NSs may have roaming agreement with a third NS (e.g., Home NS and 3rd NS having a 645 \\nHandover Roaming agreement, and the 3rd NS and the Visited NS having a Passive Roaming 646 \\nagreement). 647 \\n 648 \\n11.2 Roaming Policy 649 \\n 650 \\nEach network operator SHALL be configured with a roaming policy that can individually 651 \\nallow/disallow Passive Roaming, Handover Roaming, Passive Roaming based Activation, 652 \\nHandover Roaming based Activation with other network operators identified by their NetIDs.

Following interfaces carry both the backend 1896 \\nrequest and answer messages over HTTP Requests while using HTTP Responses simply for 1897 \\nacknowledging the delivery: fNS-sNS, sNS-hNS. When the delivery is successful, independently 1898 \\nof the backend answer result, HTTP Response SHOULD use HTTP 2xx Status-Code class of 1899 \\nresponse. Only when the delivery is not successful (e.g. malformed HTTP request), HTTP 1900 \\nResponse SHOULD use HTTP 4xx or 5xx Status-Code class of response. In that case the 1901 \\nbackend request SHALL NOT be answered. Following interfaces carry the backend request 1902 \\nmessages over HTTP Requests, whereas the backend answer messages may be carried over 1903 \\neither the HTTP Response or a subsequent HTTP Request: hNS-JS, vNS-JS, AS-JS.  The 1904 \\nmethod used by the JS for each backend peer is determined out-of-band. Notification messages 1905 \\nare one-way messages. They are carried over HTTP Requests while the returned HTTP 1906 \\nResponses simply acknowledge their delivery. 1907 \\n 1908 \\nNetwork elements SHALL use JSON data format for sending request, answer, and notification 1909 \\nmessages. When a network element has a message to send to another network element in 1910 \\nHTTP Request, it SHALL generate an HTTP POST Request for Target URL. Target URL is a 1911 \\nconfiguration parameter that is agreed upon between the two network elements interfacing with 1912 \\neach other. For example, on a given NS, the Target URL for a JS can be 1913 \\n\"https://js.lora_operator.com\". Because a given NS may be serving multiple roles at the same 1914 \\ntime (acting as fNS, sNS, and hNS), sender of a request SHALL indicate the intended receiver 1915 \\non the target NS by appending one of the following extensions to the Target URL: “/fns”, “/sns”, 1916 \\n“/hns”. An example Target URL for a request sent to the hNS part of a server is 1917 \\n“https://ns.lora_operator.com/hns”. In case of Roaming Activation, role of the visited NS is not 1918 \\ndetermined until it receives the ProfileAns message from hNS. The sender of the backend 1919 \\nanswer messages transmitted prior to that determination (more specifically, HomeNSAns and 1920 \\nProfileAns messages) SHALL use the fNS URL of the visited NS. 1921 \\n 1922 \\nHTTP carries the request, answer, and notification messages as a JSON-encoded payload with 1923 \\nvarious objects. Messages SHALL use \"application/json\" Media type (HTTP Content-Type 1924 \\nheader field). Names of the objects that need to be included in a given message are provided in 1925 \\nthe sections that describe the detailed message flows. Encoding of each object type is provided 1926 \\nin Section 23.3. Each message SHALL include a ProtocolVersion object whose value is set to 1927 \\n“1.1” by the implementations of this specification, MessageType object that defines the action 1928 \\nrequired for that message, and SenderID and ReceiverID objects. The sender of the message 1929 \\nSHALL set the SenderID to the NetID, JoinEUI, or AS-ID of the sender, depending on whether 1930 \\nthe sender is an NS or JS or an AS, respectively. Similarly, the sender of the message SHALL 1931 \\nset the ReceiverID to the NetID, JoinEUI, or AS-ID of the intended receiver, depending on 1932 \\nwhether the receiver is an NS or JS or an AS, respectively. The sender SHALL include 1933 \\nSenderNSID if it is an NS, and ReceiverNSID if the receiver is an NS. 1934 \\n 1935 \\nIn order for a network element to be able to match a received message with the pending 1936 \\nrequest/answer message a TransactionID is used. The sender of a request message SHALL 1937 \\ninclude a TransactionID in the message whose value setting is at the discretion of the sender. 1938 \\nThe sender of an answer or notification message SHALL include the same TransactionID that 1939 \\nwas received in the message that triggered the answer or notification message. If a network 1940 \\nelement receives an answer or notification message for which there is no associated request or 1941 \\nanswer with the TransactionID value, then it SHALL discard the received message. 1942 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/TS002-1.1.0_LoRaWAN_Backend_Interfaces.pdf', 'page': 68}, page_content=' \\nTS2-1.1.0 LoRaWAN Backend Interfaces \\n \\n©2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 69 of 85 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n 1943 \\nIf the ProtocolVersion of the received message is not set to “1.0” or “1.1”, then the receiving 1944 \\nnetwork element SHALL return a message carrying Result=InvalidProtocolVersion.

optimized for battery-276 \\npowered end-devices that may be either mobile or mounted at a fixed location.  277 \\nLoRaWAN networks are typically laid out in a star-of-stars topology in which gateways1 relay 278 \\ntransmissions between end-devices and a central Network Server at the backend.  Gateways 279 \\nare connected to a Network Server via standard IP connections , whereas end-devices use 280 \\nsingle-hop radio-frequency (RF) communication to one or many gateways.  All communication 281 \\nis generally bi -directional, although uplink communication from an end-device to a Network 282 \\nServer is expected to be the predominant traffic. 283 \\nCommunication between end-devices and gateways is distributed over different frequency 284 \\nchannels and data rates. Selecting the data rate is a tradeoff between communication range 285 \\nand transmission duration; communications with different LoRa data rates do not interfere with 286 \\neach other. To maximize both the battery life of end-devices and the overall network capacity, 287 \\nthe LoRaWAN network infrastructure MAY manage the data rate and RF transmit power for 288 \\neach end-device individually by means of an adaptive data rate (ADR) scheme. 289 \\nAn end-device may transmit on any channel available at any time  using any available data 290 \\nrate, as long as the following rules are observed: 291 \\n\\uf0b7 The end-device changes channels in a pseudo-random fashion for every transmission. The 292 \\nresulting frequency diversity makes the system more robust to interference.  293 \\n\\uf0b7 The end -device pseudo -randomly changes its transmit periodici ty to prevent systematic 294 \\nsynchronization of populations of end-device transmissions. 295 \\n\\uf0b7 The end-device complies with all local regulations governing its behavior in the band and 296 \\nsub-bands in which it is currently operating including, but not limited to, duty-cycle and dwell-297 \\ntime (transmit-duration) limitations. 298 \\nAll LoRaWAN end-devices SHALL implement at least Class A functionality as  described in 299 \\nthis document. In addition, they MAY implement Class B and/or Class C as also described in 300 \\nthis document. 301 \\nEnd-devices implementing Class B are referred to as Class B-capable. When operating in 302 \\nClass B, end-devices are referred to as Class B-enabled. Transition from Class B-disabled to 303 \\nClass B-enabled is called switching to Class B. 304 \\nEnd-devices implementing Class C are referred to as Class C-capable. When operating in 305 \\nClass C, end-devices are referred to as Class C-enabled. Transition from Class C-disabled to 306 \\nClass C-enabled is called switching to Class C. 307 \\nIn all cases, end-devices remain compatible with Class A. 308 \\n                                                \\n1 Gateways are also known as concentrators, routers, access points, or base stations.

End-devices implementing more than Class A are generally called 328 \\n“higher Class end-devices” in this document. 329 \\n2.1 LoRaWAN Classes 330 \\nA LoRaWAN network distinguishes between a basic LoRaWAN (called Class A) and optional 331 \\nfeatures (Class B, Class C …) as shown in Figure 1. 332 \\n 333 \\n 334 \\n 335 \\nFigure 1: LoRaWAN Classes 336 \\n 337 \\n\\uf0b7 Bi-directional end -devices (Class A):  Class A e nd-devices allow bi -directional 338 \\ncommunications, whereby each end-device’s uplink transmission is followed by two short 339 \\ndownlink receive windows. The transmission slot scheduled by the end-device is based on 340 \\nits own communication needs, with a small variation based on a random time basis (ALOHA-341 \\ntype protocol). Class A operation is the lowest-power end-device system for applications 342 \\nthat require only downlink communication from the server shortly after the end-device has 343 \\nsent an uplink transmission. Downlink communications from the server at any other time will 344 \\nhave to wait until the next uplink initiated by the end-device. 345 \\n\\uf0b7 Bi-directional end-devices with scheduled receive slots (Class B):  Class B-capable 346 \\nend-devices allow more receive slots. In addit ion to Class A receive windows, Class B -347 \\nenabled end-devices open extra receive windows at scheduled times. In order for the end-348 \\ndevice to open its receive windows at a scheduled time, it receives a time-synchronized 349 \\nbeacon from the gateway. This allows the Network Server to know when the end-device is 350 \\nlistening. 351 \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 10 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Bi-directional end-devices with maximal receive slots (Class C): Class C-capable end-352 \\ndevices allow nearly continuously open receive windows , which are closed only when 353 \\ntransmitting. Class C-enabled end-devices use more power to operate than Class A or Class 354 \\nB-enabled, but they feature the lowest latency for communication between servers and end-355 \\ndevices. 356 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 11 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\nCLASS A – ALL END-DEVICES 357 \\n 358 \\nAll LoRaWAN end-devices SHALL implement all Class A features  not explicitly marked 359 \\noptional. 360 \\n 361 \\nNote: Physical packet format, MAC frame format and other parts of this 362 \\nspecification that are common to both end-devices of Class A and higher 363 \\nClasses are described only in the LoRaWAN Class A specification in 364 \\norder to avoid redundancy. 365 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 12 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n3 Physical Packet Formats 366 \\nThe physical layers used by LoRaWAN are defined in [RP002]. 367 \\nThe LoRaWAN terminology distinguishes between uplink and downlink frames. 368 \\n3.1 Uplink Packets 369 \\nUplink packets are sent by end-devices to a Network Server  relayed by one or many 370 \\ngateways. 371 \\n3.2 Downlink Packets 372 \\nDownlink packets are sent by a Network Server to only one end-device and are transmitted 373 \\nby a Network Server through one or more gateways.2  374 \\n3.3 Receive Windows 375 \\nFollowing each uplink transmission, the end-device SHALL open one or two receive windows 376 \\n(RX1 and RX2); if no packet destined for the end-device is received in RX1, it SHALL open 377 \\nRX2. The receive window s start times are defined using the end of the transmission as a 378 \\nreference, see Figure 2. 379 \\n 380 \\n 381 \\nFigure 2: End-device receive-slot timing 382 \\n 383 \\n3.3.1 Receiver activity during receive windows 384 \\nIf a preamble is detected during one of the receive windows, the radio receiver SHOULD stay 385 \\nactive until the downlink frame is demodulated. If a frame was detected and subsequently 386 \\ndemodulated during the first receive window, and the frame was intended for this end-device 387 \\nafter address and MIC (message integrity code) checks, the end -device SHALL NOT open 388 \\nthe second receive window. 389 \\n                                                \\n2 This specification does not describe the transmission of multicast frames from a Network Server to \\nmany end-devices. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 13 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n3.3.2 First receive-window channel, data rate, and start 390 \\nThe first receive window RX1 uses a frequency that is a function of the uplink frequency and 391 \\na data rate that is a function of the uplink data rate. RX1 SHALL be open no longer than  392 \\nRECEIVE_DELAY1 seconds after the end of the uplink modulation.3 The relationship between 393 \\nuplink and RX1 data rate s is region-specific and detailed in  the “LoRaWAN Regional 394 \\nParameters” [RP002] document. 395 \\n3.3.3 Second receive window channel, data rate, and start 396 \\nThe second receive window RX2, if opened ( see Section 3.3.1), uses a fixed configurable 397 \\nfrequency and data rate , and SHALL be open no longer than  RECEIVE_DELAY2 seconds 398 \\nafter the end of the uplink modulation.3 The frequency and data rate can be modified by MAC 399 \\ncommands (see Section 5). The default frequency and data rate are region-specific and 400 \\ndetailed in “LoRaWAN Regional Parameters” [RP002]. 401 \\n3.3.4 Receive window duration 402 \\nThe duration of a receive window SHALL be at least the time required by the end -device’s 403 \\nradio transceiver to detect a downlink preamble starting at RECEIVE_DELAY1 or 404 \\nRECEIVE_DELAY2 after the end of the uplink modulation.  405 \\n 406 \\nNote: The end-device receive window duration has to accommodate the 407 \\nmaximum potential imprecision of the end-device’s clock.

This feature is used by Network Servers to adapt and optimize the number of 519 \\nretransmissions, the data rate, and the TX power of end-devices. This is referred to as the 520 \\nadaptive data rate (ADR) and, when it is enabled, end-devices will be optimized to use the 521 \\nfastest data rate and minimum TX power possible. 522 \\nADR control may not be possible when radio channel attenuation changes rapidly and/or 523 \\ncontinuously. When the Network is unable to control the data rate of an end-device, the end-524 \\ndevice’s application layer SHOULD control it. It is RECOMMENDED that a variety of different 525 \\ndata rates be used in this case.  The application layer SHOULD always try to minimize the 526 \\naggregated airtime, given the network conditions. 527 \\nIf the uplink ADR bit is set, the Network may control the number of retransmissions, the data 528 \\nrate, and the TX power of the end-device through the appropriate MAC commands. If the ADR 529 \\nbit is unset, the Network Server SHALL accept that the end-device MAY not comply with any 530 \\nattempt to control the number of retransmissions, the data rate, or the TX power of the end-531 \\ndevice regardless of the received signal quality.  The Network MAY still send commands to 532 \\ninform the end-device of the recommended configuration using the LinkADRReq command. 533 \\nAn end-device SHOULD accept the channel mask controls present in LinkADRReq, even 534 \\nwhen the ADR bit is not set. The end-device SHALL respond to all LinkADRReq commands 535 \\nwith a LinkADRAns indicating which command elements were acc epted and which were 536 \\nrejected. This behavior differs from when the uplink ADR bit is set, in which case the end-537 \\ndevice accepts or rejects the entire command. 538 \\n 539 \\nNote: A Network Server may not infer any actual end-device state in the 540 \\ncase where the uplink ADR bit is not set, regardless of the state of the 541 \\nindividual Status bits of LinkADRAns.

End-devices SHALL use this 563 \\npower level until the Network attempts to change it using the LinkADRReq MAC command, 564 \\nor if the end-device has unset the ADR bit. 565 \\nThe default data rate is the minimum data rate allowed for an end-device, considering its 566 \\ncapabilities and any applicable regional regulatory constraints.

A Class A downlink frame received following an uplink 581 \\nframe SHALL reset the ADRACKCnt counter. Upon receipt of any Class A downlink, the end-582 \\ndevice SHALL clear the ADRACKReq bit. The downlink ACK bit does not need to be set 583 \\nbecause any Class A downlink frame received by the end-device indicates that the Network 584 \\nhas received uplinks from this end-device. If no Class A downlink frame is received within the 585 \\nnext ADR_ACK_DELAY uplinks (i.e., after a total of ADR_ACK_LIMIT + ADR_ACK_DELAY 586 \\ntransmitted frames), the end-device SHALL try to regain connectivity by first setting the TX 587 \\npower to the default power, then switching to the next lower data rate that provides a longer 588 \\nradio range.

FCntUp is incremented by an end-device 679 \\nwhen a data frame is transmitted to a Network Server (uplink).  FCntDown is incremented by 680 \\na Network Server when a data frame is transmitted to an end-device (downlink).

ABP end -devices SHALL NOT reset the frame counters during the end-687 \\ndevice’s lifetime. If the end -device is susceptible to losing power during its lifetime (battery 688 \\nreplacement, for example), the frame counters SHALL persist during such an event. 689 \\nSubsequently, FCntUp is incremented with each uplink and FCntDown is incremented with 690 \\neach downlink. At the receiver side, the corresponding counter is kept in sync with the received 691 \\nvalue, provided the received value has been incremented compared to the current counter 692 \\nvalue, and the frame MIC field matches the MIC value computed locally using the appropriate 693 \\nnetwork session key.  FCntUp SHALL NOT be  incremented in the case of multiple 694 \\ntransmissions of a confirmed or unconfirmed frame (see NbTrans parameter). Network 695 \\nServers SHALL drop the application payload of the retransmitted frames and only forward a 696 \\nsingle instance to the appropriate Application Server. 697 \\nA first uplink with FCntUp=0 sent by an ABP or an OTAA end-device after a successful Join 698 \\nprocedure SHALL be accepted by a Network Server, provided the MIC field is valid. 699 \\nAnalogously, a first downlink with FCntDown=0 sent by a Network Server to an ABP or an 700 \\nOTAA end-device after a successful Join procedure SHALL be accepted by the end -device, 701 \\nprovided the MIC field is valid. 702 \\nFrame counters are 32 bits wide. T he FCnt field SHALL correspond to the least -significant 703 \\n16 bits of the 32-bit frame counter (i.e., FCntUp for data frames sent uplink and FCntDown 704 \\nfor data frames sent downlink). 705 \\nThe end-device SHALL NOT reuse the same FCntUp value with the same application or 706 \\nnetwork session keys, except for retransmission. 707 \\nThe end -device SHALL NOT process any retransmission  of the same downlink frame. 708 \\nSubsequent retransmissions SHALL be ignored without being processed. 709 \\n 710 \\n                                                \\n6 Cf.

Class B-capable end-devices SHALL NOT enable Class B and Class C operation 1608 \\nconcurrently. 1609 \\nLoRaWAN Class B option adds a synchronized reception window on the end-device. 1610 \\nOne of the limitations of LoRaWAN Class A is the ALOHA method of sending data from the 1611 \\nend-device; it does not allow for a known reaction time when the customer application or the 1612 \\nserver wants to address the end -device. The purpose of Class B is to have an  end-device 1613 \\navailable for reception at a predictable time, in addition to the reception windows that follows 1614 \\nthe random uplink transmission from the end-device of Class A. Class B is achieved by having 1615 \\nthe gateway send a beacon on a regular basis to synchr onize all end-devices in the network 1616 \\nso that the end-device can open a short additional reception window (called a ping slot) at a 1617 \\npredictable time during a periodic time slot. 1618 \\n 1619 \\nNote: The decision to switch from Class A to Class B comes from the 1620 \\napplication layer of the end-device. If this switch from Class A to Class 1621 \\nB has to be controlled from the network side, the customer application 1622 \\nmust use one of the end -device’s Class A uplinks to send back a 1623 \\ndownlink to the application layer, and it needs the appli cation layer on 1624 \\nthe end-device to recognize this request—this process is not managed 1625 \\nat the LoRaWAN level. 1626 \\n8.1 Principle of Synchronous Network-initiated Class B Downlinks 1627 \\nFor a network to support end-devices of Class B, the Network SHALL broadcast a beacon that 1628 \\nprovides a timing reference to end -devices. Based on this timing reference , the Class B -1629 \\nenabled end-devices SHALL periodically open receive windows, hereafter called ping slots, 1630 \\nwhich can be used by the Network to initiate a downlink communication. A  Network-initiated 1631 \\ndownlink using one of these ping slots is called a ping. The gateway chosen to initiate this 1632 \\ndownlink communication is selected by the Network Server. For this reason, if an end-device 1633 \\nmoves and detects a change in the identity advertised in the received beacon, it SHALL send 1634 \\nan uplink to the Network Server so that the server can update the downlink routing path 1635 \\ndatabase. 1636 \\nWhen enabling Class B mode, an end-device SHALL use the defined values for the following 1637 \\nparameters: 1638 \\n\\uf0b7 Default ping-slot periodicity 1639 \\n\\uf0b7 Default ping-slot data rate 1640 \\n\\uf0b7 Default ping-slot channel. 1641 \\nThese parameters have default values defined in the “Regional Parameters Specification” 1642 \\n[RP002] and MAY be updated via Class B MAC commands (cf. Section 12). 1643 \\nAll end-devices start and join the network as Class A end-devices with Class B disabled. The 1644 \\nend-device application can then decide to enable Class B. Class B-capable end-devices still 1645 \\nimplement all functionalities of Class A end-devices. I n particular , Class B -enabled end-1646 \\ndevices SHALL respect the Class A RX1 and RX2 receive window definition following every 1647 \\nuplink (cf. Section 3.3). 1648 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 51}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 52 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\nClass B is enabled by the following process: 1649 \\n\\uf0b7 The end -device application requests the LoRaWAN layer to enable Class B mode. The 1650 \\nLoRaWAN layer in the end-device searches for a beacon. To accelerate beacon discovery, 1651 \\nthe LoRaWAN layer MAY use the DeviceTimeReq MAC command. 1652 \\n\\uf0b7 Once the end-device has found a beacon, it MAY enable Class B mode.  1653 \\n\\uf0b7 Once Class B is enabled, the MAC layer SHALL set to 1 the ClassB bit of the FCtrl field 1654 \\nof every uplink frame transmitted to remain Class B-enabled. This bit signals to the server 1655 \\nthat the end-device has enabled Class B. 1656 \\n\\uf0b7 The MAC layer SHOULD autonomously schedule a reception slot for each beacon and each 1657 \\nping slot. The end-device SHALL take into account the maximum possible clock drift in the 1658 \\nscheduling of the beacon reception slot and ping slots. When a downlink is successfully 1659 \\ndemodulated during a ping slot, it SHALL be processed similarly to a downlink as described 1660 \\nin the LoRaWAN Class A specification.  1661 \\n\\uf0b7 A mobile end -device SHOULD periodically inform the Network Server of its location to 1662 \\nupdate the downlink route. This is done by transmitting a normal (possibly empty) 1663 \\nunconfirmed or confirmed uplink. The end-device LoRaWAN layer SHALL appropriately set 1664 \\nthe ClassB bit to 1 in the frame’s FCtrl field. This can be done more efficiently if the end-1665 \\ndevice detects that it is moving by analyzing the beacon content. In that case , to avoid 1666 \\nsystematic uplink collisions , the end-device SHALL apply a random delay (as defined in 1667 \\nSection 13.6) between having received the beacon and transmitting the uplink. 1668 \\n\\uf0b7 During any Class A downlink, t he Network Server MAY change the end-device’s ping-slot 1669 \\ndownlink frequency or data rate by sending a PingSlotChannelReq MAC command and 1670 \\nreceiving the corresponding PingSlotChannelAns. 1671 \\n\\uf0b7 The end-device MAY change the periodicity of its ping slots at any time.

A Class B-capable end-1722 \\ndevice SHALL support at least one multicast group and a n end-device SHALL NOT transmit 1723 \\nusing a multicast address. 1724 \\n 1725 \\nMore precisely, inside a given end -device, a multicast group is defined by the following 1726 \\nparameters called the multicast group context: 1727 \\n1. A 4-octet network address of the multicast group, common to all end-devices of the group. 1728 \\n2.

The same frame counter is incremented, whether the downlink uses a Class B 1741 \\nping slot or a Class A downlink slot. A downlink ping is processed by the end -device in the 1742 \\nsame way as a Class A downlink, except for MAC commands and confirmed frames.  1743 \\nA downlink ping SHALL NOT transport an y MAC command. If an end -device receives a 1744 \\ndownlink ping containing a MAC command, either in  the FOpts field (if FPort is either 1745 \\nmissing or >0) or in the FRMPayload field (if FPort=0), it SHALL silently discard the entire 1746 \\nframe.  1747 \\nIn case a confirmed downlink ping frame is received, the end-device SHALL NOT answer later 1748 \\nthan a time period equal to   CLASS_B_RESP_TIMEOUT * NbTrans + RECEIVE_DELAY2 1749 \\n* (NbTrans-1) when the end-device sets its uplink ADR bit, and CLASS_B_RESP_TIMEOUT 1750 \\nwhen the end -device unsets its uplink ADR bit. The default value of 1751 \\nCLASS_B_RESP_TIMEOUT is 8s. It can be modified in [RP002], it SHALL not be smaller 1752 \\nthan RETRANSMIT_TIMEOUT plus the maximum time on air of the uplink frame.  1753 \\n 1754 \\nNote: The purpose of this timeout is for the Network Server to know how 1755 \\nlong to wait for a response from the end -device, before it transmits 1756 \\nanother confirmed downlink. This ensures that the Network Server can 1757 \\nprocess responses without any ambiguity: there may b e only a single 1758 \\nconfirmed downlink ping pending an acknowledgement.  1759 \\n 1760 \\nThe uplink frame sent in response MAY be sent up to NbTrans times, but no retransmission 1761 \\nSHALL occur after the timeout period. It is RECOMMENDED that the end -device transmits 1762 \\neach copy of the uplink frame at a random time within CLASS_B_RESP_TIMEOUT. 1763 \\nAs this adds a timing requirement compared to responding to Class A downlinks, the end -1764 \\ndevice may not send an uplink frame within the timeout, for instance if it has a duty cycle 1765 \\nlimitation. When such an uplink frame is not sent, the end -device SHALL act as if the uplink 1766 \\nframe with the ACK bit set was sent. 1767 \\nAfter sending a confirmed downlink frame sent over pingslot, the network server SHALL NOT 1768 \\nsend any other confirmed downlink to the end -device until this timeout expires or an uplink 1769 \\nframe is received from that end-device.  1770 \\nAfter sending a Class A c onfirmed downlink, a network server SHALL NOT send any other 1771 \\nconfirmed downlink to the end-device until an uplink frame is received from that end-device. 1772 \\n 1773 \\nNote: unconfirmed downlink frames sent over ping slots may be sent 1774 \\nwithout a minimum delay between them. 1775 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 56 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n9.3.2 Multicast downlink ping frame format 1776 \\nMulticast frames share most of the unicast frame format with a few exceptions: 1777 \\n\\uf0b7 They SHALL NOT carry MAC commands in the FOpts field nor in the payload on port 0 1778 \\nbecause a multicast downlink does not have the same authentication robustness as a 1779 \\nunicast frame.

TAccuracy SHALL be less than or equal to the timing precision 2160 \\nindicated by the Prec field of the beacon TAccuracy ≤ 10−6+Prec s. 2161 \\nAll gateways participating in the broadcast of the Class B beacon must be synchronized. 2162 \\nDepending on the timing precision that can be guaranteed by the gateway , two possible 2163 \\nmodes of the Class B beacon transmission are possible. 2164 \\n TAccuracy ≤ 1 µs: gateways tightly synchronized to GPS time. 2165 \\nIf the gateway transmissions can be synchronized to the GPS clock with an accuracy of better 2166 \\nthan 1 µs, the gateway MAY transmit the beacon every 128 s. The Prec field of the beacon 2167 \\nis set to 0, indicating a timing accuracy of better than 1 µs for the listening end-devices. 2168 \\n TAccuracy > 1 µs: gateways loosely synchronized to GPS time. 2169 \\nIf gateway transmissions can be synchronized to the GPS clock with an accuracy of better 2170 \\nthan 1 ms, but an accuracy of  1 µs cannot be guaranteed, the transmission of a Class B 2171 \\nbeacon SHALL be randomized. For each beacon, the gateway SHALL draw a random number 2172 \\nP with a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. The gateway transmits the beacon if P < 2173 \\nPBeacon. If P ≥ PBeacon, the gateway remains silent and does not transmit the beacon.  2174 \\nThe parameter PBeacon exists on the gateway and MAY be remotely set by the Network 2175 \\nServer. The value of PBeacon SHALL be ≤ 0.5 (50%). Different gateways may use different 2176 \\nvalues of the P Beacon parameter. 2177 \\nThe parameter P may be a pseudo -random number but , in this case , each gateway in the 2178 \\nnetwork SHALL use a different seed, resulting in a unique series of P values.  2179 \\nIf the Class B beacons of two or more loosely synchronized gateways reach the antenna of 2180 \\nan end -device with equivalent power, the end -device may not be able to demodulate the 2181 \\nbeacon.

To avoid systematic beacon collision 2183 \\nat the antenna of a stationary end-device, randomization must take place . Each loosely 2184 \\nsynchronized gateway randomly transmits the beacon no more than half of the time. 2185 \\nTherefore, although beacon c ollisions do happen at the end-device’s antenna, they are not 2186 \\nsystematic, and the end-device can still demodulate the Class B beacon with sufficient 2187 \\nprobability to operate in Class B mode. The P Beacon parameter should be optimized by the 2188 \\nnetwork infrastructure based on the average number of gateways that local end-devices can 2189 \\nreceive. The denser the gateway population becomes, the higher the probability of beacon 2190 \\ncollision, so the lower the parameter should be.

Therefore, the Network Server SHOULD keep track of the 2199 \\napproximate position of every Class B end-device. 2200 \\nWhenever a Class B end-device moves and changes cell s, it SHALL communicate with the 2201 \\nNetwork Server in order to update its downlink route.  This update is performed simply by 2202 \\nsending a confirmed or unconfirmed uplink, possibly without applicative payload.  2203 \\nThe end-device can communicate in accordance with two basic strategies: 2204 \\n\\uf0b7 Systematic periodic uplink : This is the simplest method as it  does not require 2205 \\ndemodulation of the gateway -specific field of the beacon. It is applicable only to slowly 2206 \\nmoving or stationery end-devices. No requirements are imposed on such periodic uplinks. 2207 \\n\\uf0b7 Uplink on cell change: The end-device can demodulate the optional gateway-specific field 2208 \\nof the beacon. It detects that the ID of the gateway broadcasting the beacon it demodulates 2209 \\nhas changed and sends an uplink. In that case, the end-device SHALL respect a pseudo-2210 \\nrandom delay within the range of [0s:120s] between the beacon demodulation and the 2211 \\nuplink transmission to ensure that the uplinks of multiple Class B end-devices entering or 2212 \\nleaving a cell during the same beacon period will not systematically occur at the same time 2213 \\nimmediately after the beacon broadcast. 2214 \\nFailure to report a cell change can result in a Class B downlink being temporar ily not 2215 \\noperational.  2216 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 72}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 73 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n14 Class B Unicast and Multicast Downlink Channel Frequencies 2217 \\nThe Class B downlink channel selection mechanism depends on the way the Class B beacon 2218 \\nis broadcast. 2219 \\n14.1 Single-Channel Beacon Transmission 2220 \\nIn certain regions (e.g., EU868), a beacon is transmitted on a single channel. In that case, all 2221 \\nunicast and multicast Class B downlinks SHALL use a single fr equency channel defined by 2222 \\nthe PingSlotChannelReq MAC command. The default frequency is defined in [RP002]. 2223 \\n14.2 Frequency-Hopping Beacon Transmission 2224 \\nIn certain regions (e.g., US902-928 or CN470-510), a Class B beacon SHALL be transmitted 2225 \\nfollowing a frequency-hopping pattern. 2226 \\nIn certain regions (e.g., CN470 -510), the default Class B downlink channel is subject to the 2227 \\ndefinition in the “Regional Parameters” document [RP002]. 2228 \\nIn other regions with a hopping beacon, by default Class B ping slots SHALL use a channel 2229 \\nthat is a function of the Time field of the previous beacon (see Section 13.2) and the value of 2230 \\nDevAddr. 2231 \\nClass B ping − slot channel = [DevAddr + floor ( BeaconTime\\nBeaconPeriod)]  modulo NbChannel , 2232 \\nwhere  2233 \\n\\uf0b7 BeaconTime is the 32-bit Time field of the current beacon period. 2234 \\n\\uf0b7 BeaconPeriod is the length of the beacon period (defined as 128 s in the specification). 2235 \\n\\uf0b7 floor designates rounding to the immediately lower integer value. 2236 \\n\\uf0b7 DevAddr is the 32-bit network address of the end-device or multicast group. 2237 \\n\\uf0b7 NbChannel is the number of channels over which the beacon is frequency hopping. 2238 \\nClass B downlinks therefore hop across NbChannel channels (identical to the beacon 2239 \\ntransmit channels) in the ISM band, and all Class B end-devices are equally spread amongst 2240 \\nthe NbChannel downlink channels.  2241 \\nIf the PingSlotChannelReq command with a valid non-zero Frequency argument sets the 2242 \\nClass B downlink frequency, then all subsequent ping slots SHOULD be opened on this single 2243 \\nfrequency independently of the previous beacon frequency. 2244 \\nIf the PingSlotChannelReq command with a zero Frequency argument is sent, the end -2245 \\ndevice SHOULD resume the default frequency plan, that is, Class B ping slots hopping across 2246 \\nNbChannel channels. 2247 \\nThe underlying idea is to allow network operators to configure end -devices to use a sing le 2248 \\nproprietary dedicated frequency band for Class B downlinks if available, and to maintain as 2249 \\nmuch frequency diversity as possible when the ISM band is used. 2250 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 73}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 74 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\nCLASS C – CONTINUOUSLY LISTENING 2251 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 74}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 75 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n15 Continuously Listening End-Device (Class C) 2252 \\nClass C mode is used for applications that have sufficient power available such that they do 2253 \\nnot need to minimize the time the radio receiver is active as they do in Class A or Class B 2254 \\napplications. 2255 \\nClass C-capable end-devices SHALL NOT enable Class B and Class C concurrently. Class A 2256 \\ndownlink, however, are always available after an end-device uplink. 2257 \\nA Class C-enabled end-device listens as often as possible using a combination of channel/DR 2258 \\nparameters referred to as  RXC. The end -device SHALL listen on RX C when it is not (a) 2259 \\ntransmitting or (b) receiving on RX1  or (c) receiving on RX2 , according to the Class A 2260 \\ndefinition. To do so, it SHALL open a short window on RX C parameters between the end of 2261 \\nthe uplink transmission and the beginning of the RX1 reception window . It SHALL open  2262 \\nanother RXC window between the end of the RX1 window and the beginning of the RX2 2263 \\nwindow, and it SHALL switch to RX C reception parameters as soon as the RX 2 reception 2264 \\nwindow is closed. This final RXC reception window SHALL remain open until the end-device 2265 \\nbegins to send another packet. 2266 \\nIf the end-device is in the process of demodulating a downlink using the RXC parameters 2267 \\nwhen the RX1 or RX2 window should be opened, it SHALL stop the demodulation and switch 2268 \\nto the RX1 or RX2 receive window. This applies even when the RXC and RX2 parameters are 2269 \\nidentical. The purpose of this rule is to achieve a clear separation between downlinks received 2270 \\nduring RX1 and RX2 windows (called Class A downl inks) and downlinks received during a 2271 \\nClass C window (called Class C downlinks). The same frame counter is incremented, whether 2272 \\nthe downlink uses RX1/RX2 or RXC. 2273 \\n 2274 \\nNote: In order to take advantage of the network -initiated downlink 2275 \\ncapabilities provided by Class C, the network needs relatively recent 2276 \\ninformation of how to best contact the end -device. This information is 2277 \\nprovided to the network through any and all uplinks received from the 2278 \\nend-device. For this reason it is important for Class C enabled end -2279 \\ndevices to send regular uplinks which implicitly inform the network of the 2280 \\nbest way to contact it as well as providing the network a chance to send 2281 \\nnew MAC commands which may be required for proper end -device 2282 \\noperation. 2283 \\n 2284 \\nA Class C downlink SHALL NOT transport any MAC command.

Typical applications include FUOTA and simultaneously controlling a group 2334 \\nof end-evices such as streetlights. 2335 \\nThe RXC window parameters differ, depending on whether the Class C functionality is used 2336 \\nto receive unicast or multicast downlinks: 2337 \\n\\uf0b7 Unicast:  The RXC parameters are identical to the RX2 parameters, and they use the same 2338 \\nchannel and data rate. Modifying the RX 2 parameters using the appropriate MAC 2339 \\ncommands also modifies the RXC parameters. 2340 \\n\\uf0b7 Multicast: The RXC parameters are provided by the application layer. All end-devices in the 2341 \\nmulticast group SHALL share the same RXC parameters. If the multicast RXC parameters 2342 \\nare different from the end-device’s RX2 parameters, then the end-device is not able to listen 2343 \\nsimultaneously to multicast and unicast downlink. In that case , the decision whether the 2344 \\nend-device should use unicast or multicast RXC parameters is application-specific. If the 2345 \\nmulticast RXC parameters provided by the application layer match the current RX2 2346 \\nparameters of the end-device, then the end-device receives both unicast and multicast 2347 \\ntraffic during the RXC windows. 2348 \\n15.1 Class C Multicast Downlinks 2349 \\nAnalogously to Class B, Class C end-devices can receive multicast downlink frames. The 2350 \\nmulticast address and associated network session key SHALL come from the Network Server, 2351 \\nand the application session key SHALL come from the Application Server. 2352 \\n 2353 \\nMore precisely, inside a given end -device, a multicast group is defined by the following 2354 \\nparameters called the multicast group context: 2355 \\n1. A 4-octet network address of the multicast group, common to all end-devices of the group. 2356 \\n2. A multicast group-specific session key, different for every multicast group; all end-devices 2357 \\nof a given multicast group have the same session keys. 2358 \\n3. A multicast group-specific downlink frame counter. 2359 \\nExample: [TS005] provides an application layer mechanism to set up a 2360 \\nmulticast group over the air.  2361 \\n 2362 \\nThe following limitations apply for Class C multicast downlink frames: 2363 \\n\\uf0b7 They SHALL NOT carry MAC commands in the FOpts field nor in the payload on port 0 2364 \\nbecause a multicast downlink does not have the same authentication robustness as a 2365 \\nunicast frame. The end-device SHALL discard any multicast frame carrying MAC 2366 \\ncommands. 2367 \\n\\uf0b7 The ACK bits SHALL be 0 and the FType field SHALL carry the value for Unconfirmed 2368 \\nData Down. The end-device SHALL discard the multicast frame otherwise. 2369 \\n\\uf0b7 Given that a Class C end-device keeps its receiver active most of the time, the FPending 2370 \\nbit does not trigger a specific behavior of the end-device and SHALL NOT be used. 2371 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 77}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 78 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\nSUPPORT INFORMATION 2372 \\nThis subsection is informative. 2373 \\n 2374 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 78}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 79 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n16 Informative Examples 2375 \\nThe following examples are illustrat ions of the LoRaWAN specification for informational 2376 \\npurposes only and are not part of the formal specification. 2377 \\n16.1 Uplink Timing Diagram for Unconfirmed Data Frames 2378 \\nThe following diagram illustrates the steps executed by an end -device transmitting a single 2379 \\nunconfirmed data frame: 2380 \\n 2381 \\n 2382 \\n 2383 \\n 2384 \\nFigure 7: Uplink timing diagram for unconfirmed data frames, NbTrans=1 2385 \\n 2386 \\nThe end-device first transmits a n unconfirmed data frame at an arbitrary instant and on an 2387 \\narbitrary channel. The uplink frame counter Cu is simply derived by adding 1 to the previous 2388 \\nuplink frame counter.

This downlink frame uses a data rate and channel specified by the regional 2392 \\nchannel plan defined in [RP002]. The downlink frame counter Cd is also derived by adding 1 2393 \\nto the downlink frame counter previously used to transmit to that specific end-device.  2394 \\nThe uplink frame counter obeys the constraints imposed by NbTrans:  the end-device is 2395 \\ncompelled to transmit the uplink NbTrans times or until a downlink is received in the Class 2396 \\nA receive windows .  In this example, as NbTrans=1, the next uplink will be sent with 2397 \\nFCntUp = Cu + 1.

No downlink transmission occurs  in the 2411 \\ncorresponding class A windows, as no response is required : Network Server might not have 2412 \\ndata or MAC commands to transmit to the end-device, or a downlink transmission to another 2413 \\nend-device might be active. In the absence of downlink, end -device waits an arbitrary delay 2414 \\nafter the end of second class A window, before transmitting the uplink again  with same Cu, 2415 \\nusing a different channel. A data downlink frame is then received, on the first class A window 2416 \\nfollowing this second transmission. As a consequence of this downlink reception, the third 2417 \\ntransmission does not occur.  2418 \\nThis transmission complies with all the specified behaviors defined in this document, including 2419 \\nchannel selection, timing randomization and duty-cycle limitations.  2420 \\n 2421 \\n16.2 Uplink Timing Diagram for Confirmed Data Frames 2422 \\nThe following diagram illustrates the steps executed by an end -device transmitting two 2423 \\nconfirmed data frames (Data0 and Data1) with NbTrans=1. 2424 \\n 2425 \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 80}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 81 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n 2426 \\nFigure 9: Uplink timing diagram for confirmed data frames 2427 \\n 2428 \\nThe end-device first transmits a confirmed data frame containing the Data0 payload at an 2429 \\narbitrary instant and on an arbitrary channel. The uplink frame counter Cu is simply derived 2430 \\nby adding 1 to the previous uplink frame counter. The Network Server receives the frame and 2431 \\ngenerates a downlink frame with the ACK bit set , which is transmitted exactly 2432 \\nRECEIVE_DELAY1 or RECEIVE_DELAY2 seconds later, using the first or second receive 2433 \\nwindow of the end -device, respectively. This downlink frame uses a data rate and channel 2434 \\nspecified by the regional channel plan defined in [RP002]. The downlink frame counter Cd is 2435 \\nalso derived by adding 1 to the downlink frame counter previously used to tran smit to that 2436 \\nspecific end-device. If there is no downlink payload pending, the Network Server may send a 2437 \\nframe without a payload. In this example, the frame carrying the ACK bit is not received by the 2438 \\nend-device. The second receive window is here opened, because frame reception failure 2439 \\nhappens before this window starts. 2440 \\nIf an end -device does not receive a frame with the ACK bit set in one of the two receive 2441 \\nwindows immediately following the uplink transmission, it may resend the payload after waiting 2442 \\nat least RETRANSMIT_TIMEOUT seconds after RX2. The uplink frame counter obeys the 2443 \\nconstraints imposed by NbTrans:  the end -device is compelled to transmit the uplink 2444 \\nNbTrans times or until a downlink is received in the Class A receive windows . In this 2445 \\nexample, as NbTrans=1, the repeated payload will be sent with FCntUp = Cu+1. After this 2446 \\nrepeated payload, t he end -device receives the ACK downlink during its RX1, with 2447 \\nFCntDn = Cd+1. The end-device is then free to transmit a new frame on a new channel and 2448 \\nis not required to open RX2. 2449 \\nThe downlink frames in this example carry an application payload. A downlink frame can carry 2450 \\nany combination of ACK, MAC control commands and payload.  2451 \\n16.3 Downlink Diagram for Confirmed Data Frames 2452 \\nThe following diagram illustrates the basic sequence of a confirmed downlink data frame. 2453 \\n 2454 \\n 2455 \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 81}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 82 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n 2456 \\nFigure 10: Downlink timing diagram for confirmed data frames 2457 \\n 2458 \\nThe frame exchange may be initiated by the end -device transmitting a confirmed or  2459 \\nunconfirmed data frame, or autonomously by the Network Server using the end-device’s Class 2460 \\nB ping-slot or Class C RXC window (if the end -device is currently Class B -enabled or Class 2461 \\nC-enabled). Upon receiving the downlink data frame requiring an acknowledgement, the end-2462 \\ndevice transmits an uplink data frame with the ACK bit set at the time of its choosing. This 2463 \\nframe might also contain piggybacked application payload data and/or MAC commands. This 2464 \\nuplink is treated like any other uplink, and as such, this transmission complies with all specified 2465 \\nbehaviors defined in this document, including channel selection, timing randomization and 2466 \\nduty-cycle limitations. 2467 \\n 2468 \\nNote: To allow end-devices to be as simple as possible and keep as few 2469 \\nstates as possible , the end-device may transmit an ex plicit (possibly 2470 \\nempty) acknowledgement data frame immediately after receiving a data 2471 \\nframe requiring an acknowledgment. Alternatively, the end -device may 2472 \\ndefer the transmission of an acknowledgement to piggyback it with its 2473 \\nnext data frame. 2474 \\nAs there is no specified timing of the acknowledgement sent by the end-2475 \\ndevice, out-of-band coordination between the Network Server and the 2476 \\nClass B or Class C -capable end -device is recommended to prevent 2477 \\nexcessive retransmissions of confirmed downlinks on Class B ping-slots 2478 \\nor Class C RXC windows.  2479 \\n16.4 Downlink Timing for Frame-Pending Frames 2480 \\nThe following diagram illustrates the use of the FPending bit on a downlink. The FPending 2481 \\nbit can only be set on a downlink frame. When present in a downlink received in a Class A 2482 \\nreceive window, the FPending bit informs the end-device that the Network has one or more 2483 \\ndownlink frames pending for the end-device. When present in a downlink received in a Class 2484 \\nB ping-slot, FPending is used to prioritize conflicting ping slots, see Section 9.2 for details. 2485 \\nFPending has no meaning in a downlink received in a Class C RXC window. 2486 \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 82}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 83 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\nIf a Class A end-device receives a frame where FPending is set, it is recommended that the 2487 \\nend-device transmit an uplink data frame as soon as reasonably possible, which would allow 2488 \\nthe end-device to receive more information from the Network. However, the precise timing of 2489 \\nthe uplink transmission is not specified and is application-dependent. 2490 \\nNote: The FPending bit is independent of the frame-acknowledgment 2491 \\nmechanism. 2492 \\n 2493 \\n 2494 \\n 2495 \\nFigure 11: Downlink timing diagram for frame-pending frames, example 1 2496 \\n 2497 \\nIn this example, the Network Server has two data frames to transmit to the end -device. The 2498 \\nframe exchange is initiated by the end -device via a normal unconfirmed uplink data frame. 2499 \\nThe Network Server uses the first receive window to transmit the Data0 downlink data frame 2500 \\nwith the bit FPending set, as a n unconfirmed downlink data frame. The end -device, in 2501 \\nresponse to the FPending indication, transmits quickly an empty unconfirmed data frame. 2502 \\nExactly RECEIVE_DELAY1 seconds later, the Network Server transmits the second downlink 2503 \\ndata frame Data1, using a confirmed downlink data frame but with the FPending bit 2504 \\ncleared. The end-device transmits an uplink data frame with the ACK bit set to acknowledge 2505 \\nthe confirmed downlink data frame Data1.  2506 \\n 2507 \\n 2508 \\nFigure 12: Downlink timing diagram for frame-pending frames, example 2 2509 \\n 2510 \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 83}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 84 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\nIn this example, the downlink data frames are both unconfirmed frames with the FPending 2511 \\nbit set, and as such, the end -device does not need to transmit an acknowledgement. After 2512 \\nreceiving the Data0 unconfirmed downlink data frame with the FPending bit set, the end-2513 \\ndevice sends an empty data frame at a time of its own choosing. As this uplink is not received 2514 \\nby the Network, the Network Server is then still waiting for a spontaneous uplink from the end-2515 \\ndevice to execute the transfer. The end-device may, at its discretion, offer the Network Server 2516 \\nmore transmission opportunities by sending a new empty data frame. 2517 \\n 2518 \\nThe FPending bit, the ACK bit, and payload data may all be present in the same downlink. 2519 \\nThe following frame exchange is a perfectly valid example with NbTrans=1. 2520 \\n  2521 \\n 2522 \\nFigure 13: Downlink timing diagram for frame-pending frames, example 3 2523 \\n 2524 \\nThe end-device sends a confirmed uplink data frame. The Network Server may then answer 2525 \\nwith a confirmed downlink data frame containing the Data0 application payload, ACK bit set 2526 \\nand FPending bit set. After an arbitrary delay, the end-device then replies with an uplink with 2527 \\nthe ACK bit set. The end -device misses next downlink containing Data1, this data was 2528 \\nexpected by the end-device because of the previous frame  FPending indication. After an 2529 \\narbitrary delay, it offers the Network Server another opportunity to send the pending data using 2530 \\nan empty frame. This time, Data1 is received by the end-device, and acknowledged.  2531 \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LoRaWAN Link Layer Specification v1.0.4.pdf', 'page': 84}, page_content='  LoRaWAN® L2 1.0.4 Specification \\n \\n© 2020 LoRa Alliance® Page 85 of 90 The authors reserve the right to change \\nspecifications without notice. \\n \\n17 Revisions  2532 \\n17.1 Revision 1.0 2533 \\n\\uf0b7 Approved version of LoRaWAN1.0 2534 \\n17.2 Revision 1.0.1 2535 \\n\\uf0b7 Clarified the RX window start time definition 2536 \\n\\uf0b7 Corrected the maximum payload size for DR2 in the NA section 2537 \\n\\uf0b7 Corrected the typo on the downlink data rate range in 7.2.2 2538 \\n\\uf0b7 Introduced a requirement for using coding rate 4/5 in 7.2.2 to guarantee a maximum 2539 \\ntime on air < 400 mSec 2540 \\n\\uf0b7 Corrected the JoinAccept MIC calculation in 6.2.5 2541 \\n\\uf0b7 Clarified the NbRep field and renamed it to NbTrans in 5.2 2542 \\n\\uf0b7 Removed the possibility to not encrypt the Applicative payload in the MAC layer , 2543 \\nremoved the paragraph 4.3.3.2.

LoRaWAN Certification will confirm that the End -Device meets the Functional 180 \\nRequirements of the LoRaWAN Specification Version L2 1.0.4 [1] for the corresponding regional 181 \\nparameters as defined in the LoRaWAN Regional Parameters Version RP2 1.0.1 [2].   182 \\n1.1. Scope of LoRaWAN Certification 183 \\nThe scope of this test specification is limited to validating compliant implementation of the LoRaWAN 184 \\nprotocol for Class A Devices.   185 \\nFor LoRaWAN Certification it is not mandatory that the End -Device has all the Regulatory approval s, 186 \\nbut these will be required before the product can be sold or operated in the respective countries. 187 \\nIntended or otherwise, t he inevitable variability of performance and quality of the radio 188 \\nimplementation among End-Devices is too high to allow normalized -, practical evaluation. RF 189 \\nperformance measurement, whether radiated or conducted, is therefore considered out of scope for 190 \\nthe tests described herein. The RF performance of the End -Device will be tested solely as part of the 191 \\nRF Performance Testing, which will be a separate test conducted at the Authorized Test House to 192 \\nevaluate the RF performance of the device as part of LoRaWAN Certification testing.  193 \\n1.2. LoRaWAN Certification Process 194 \\nA party seeking LoRaWAN Certification for their End-Device must be a member of the LoRa Alliance in 195 \\ngood standing and only Test Houses designated accredited by the LoRa Alliance may perform the tests 196 \\ndescribed herein to earn it.   197 \\nThe Authorized Test Houses must communicate the complete results to the LoRa Alliance. If the device 198 \\nhas passed all mandatory tests, the LoRa Alliance will issue a certificate for the End-Device with respect 199 \\nto a version of this document and in turn corresponding versions of [1] and [2]. Additionally, the 200 \\nAlliance will publish both the status and a results summary on its web site along with data for any 201 \\noptional features tested. 202 \\n1.3.

Functional Test Description for LoRaWAN Certification 233 \\nThe list of tests specified below reflects the functional requirements of a Class-A End-Device as defined 234 \\nin [1]. The tests are conducted in a test harness generally comprised of: 235 \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\nFigure 1: Test Harness Architecture \\n \\n• A Test Control Layer [TCL] \\n• A LoRaWAN Network Server [NS] \\n• 8/16/64 channel LoRaWAN gateway [GW] \\n• The End-Device Under Test [DUT] \\n 236 \\nNote:  237 \\n- A 16-channel gateway device will be used for all official Dynamic Channel Plan device certification 238 \\ntesting 239 \\n- A 64-channel gateway device will be used for all official Fixed Channel Plan device certification 240 \\ntesting 241 \\n- An 8 -channel gateway device could be used for unofficial pre -testing conducted at LoRaWAN 242 \\nmember labs. However, for official certification testing, 8 -channel gateway devices will not be 243 \\nused. When using an 8-channel gateway, 125kHz Channels 0-7 and 500kHz Channel 64 must be 244 \\nconfigured on the gateway. 245 \\n 246 \\nImplementation of this harness architecture is expected to vary among test houses. The Test Control 247 \\nLayer [TCL] is assumed to be a framework of automated scripts and tools that manipulates the Network 248 \\nServer [ NS] to facilitate the tests. Specifically, the TCL drives events in the harness, controlling 249 \\napplication and network-control content of downlinks. It also decrypts, inspects and validates content 250 \\nof uplinks sent by the DUT. This allows test coverage to include: 251 \\n• Cryptography 252 \\n• Timing of the DUT Receive Windows 253 \\n• Frequency Channel usage and Data Rate adaptation 254 \\n• Max Payload handling 255 \\nFor brevity reasons, this document makes procedural reference to only the TCL, NS, the DUT.   256 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LW1.0.4_End_Device_Certification_V1.0.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='  \\n LoRa Alliance \\n 5177 Brandin Court, \\n Fremont, CA 94538 USA \\n \\nLoRaWAN 1.0.4 End Device Certification  Page 12 of 162 \\nRequirements for All Regions Version 1.0  \\nCopyright © 2020 LoRa Alliance, Inc.  All rights reserved. www.lora-alliance.org \\nThe LoRaWAN gateway [GW] and DUT are collocated in an RF -isolated environment, provisioned as 257 \\nnecessary for reliable bi-directional communication. It is nonetheless expected that both the DUT and 258 \\nGW will not receive every frame intended for reception. The TCL should make reasonable effort to 259 \\naccommodate this inevitability.  The RF-isolated environment mentioned above should mitigate any 260 \\npotential interference. 261 \\nTesting occurs to certify the DUT for each supported activation method, be it over-the-air activation 262 \\n(OTAA), activation-by-personalized (ABP), or both.  263 \\nThe TCL must verify the following throughout the course of this certification test suite: 264 \\n• The DUT’s uplinks’ size must respect the maximum allowed uplink size for the data rate used. 265 \\n• The length of the DUT’s uplinks based on the expected content to ensure no extraneous and 266 \\nunnecessary content is present. 267 \\nWhen the TCL is restarted, the DUT must be set to the factory reset mode. 268 \\n 269 \\nMIC check Test Note: When the tool encounters an invalid MIC, it must fail the specific test being 270 \\nperformed. 271 \\nDownlink FPort Test Note: All MAC commands sent by the TCL will be sent on FPort 0, unless specified 272 \\notherwise in the Sequence charts in this document. 273 \\n 274 \\nChannel Mask configuration for LinkADRReq MAC command for pre-testing using an 8-275 \\nchannel gateway for Fixed Channel plan devices 276 \\nFor Fixed channel plan devices, when the MAC-CMD LinkADRReq is required to be sent 277 \\nby the TCL, if the device is being pre-tested using an 8-channel gateway, the LinkADRReq 278 \\nin the sequence charts must be replaced by the LinkADRReq commands mentioned 279 \\nbelow. The LinkADRReq must first disable all 125kHz channels, enable only the channel  280 \\n64 – 500kHz, and then enable Channels 0-7 using a second LinkADRReq.  281 \\n 282 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LW1.0.4_End_Device_Certification_V1.0.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='  \\n LoRa Alliance \\n 5177 Brandin Court, \\n Fremont, CA 94538 USA \\n \\nLoRaWAN 1.0.4 End Device Certification  Page 13 of 162 \\nRequirements for All Regions Version 1.0  \\nCopyright © 2020 LoRa Alliance, Inc.

Activation Pre-test  295 \\nSection 2.1.1 – DUT Pre -condition Activation tests - must be executed as the first test when 296 \\nexecuting a single test or multiple tests.  297 \\n 298 \\nNote: The TCL sends frames only on the RX2 window of the previous frame of the DUT for all tests 299 \\nin this document, unless specified otherwise in the Sequence Charts of the Test cases. 300 \\n 301 \\nThe DUT must support either over -the-air (OTA) activation or activation by personalization (ABP) 302 \\nor both. If the device s upports both OTAA and ABP, the device vendor must provide 2 separate 303 \\ndevices, one supporting OTAA and the other  supporting ABP method  of activation to the 304 \\nAuthorised Test House (ATH). The ATH will use the appropriate device for each activation test. In 305 \\nthe case where the device supports both OTAA and ABP for the same firmware version, the ATH 306 \\nwill run the complete test cycle for the ABP device and then test only the OTAA specific tests for 307 \\nthe OTAA device. 308 \\n2.1.1. DUT Pre-condition Activation 309 \\nAfter initial power-up – and activation if the DUT supports OTAA instead of ABP – the DUT 310 \\nmust tra nsmit an up link packet as soon as possible (recommended within 10 seconds) . 311 \\nContents of this “I’m alive” packet are unimportant.  312 \\nThe TCL replies to this packet with a downlink payload frame of [0x]0601 313 \\n(TxPeriodicityChangeReq) sent to port 224 , setting the Uplink Periodicity value to 5 seconds . 314 \\nUpon setting the uplink periodicity value, the DUT must try to send an unconfirmed/confirmed 315 \\nuplink every 5 seconds.  316 \\nIf the uplink sent by the DUT is a Confirmed frame, the TCL sends a TxFramesCtrlReq command 317 \\nto the DUT to send Unconfirmed frames thereafter.  318 \\nThe TCL then checks the ADR Bit setting of the DUT and if disabled, it enables the ADR Bit using 319 \\nthe AdrBitChannelReq command. 320 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/LORA/LW1.0.4_End_Device_Certification_V1.0.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='  \\n LoRa Alliance \\n 5177 Brandin Court, \\n Fremont, CA 94538 USA \\n \\nLoRaWAN 1.0.4 End Device Certification  Page 14 of 162 \\nRequirements for All Regions Version 1.0  \\nCopyright © 2020 LoRa Alliance, Inc.
